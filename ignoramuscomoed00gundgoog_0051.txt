COMPARISON WITH LA TRAPPOLARIA. 43

When at last the lawyer becomes insistent upon seeing Torcol,
111611 66 6 faithful client and friend, Trico tells him what he

1166 heard, namely that Antonius, 1116 rival, had solemnly vowed
‘w castrate him.

This scene has none corresponding to it in La Trappolaria. It and
the following scene were, however, an easy development from the
Italian source. There the captain, Dragoleone, did not go in person
to claim Felesia, as he intended3 while Ignoramus goes first in person,
meets with shameful defeat, and later sends Dulman also. The 101-

10111113 passages show influence from Return from Parnassus.
Bet. from Par„ II, Sc. IV, 2, l. 1638. Good Master Recorder, let

Recorder.

Ioum-amus, Sc. I I , 7.-ΤΒΙ. Η111, 111 111016111111. Detinendus ille

Ret. from Par„ II, Sc. IV, 2, l. 1642. It is his meaning 1 should
come off: 11111 11616 16 1116 11116 61116 01 6 111161116, 1116 11116 161111 01 6

nummos hic aliquot subaeratos habeo; eos ei obtrudere certum est.

Bet. from Par„ II, 8ο. IV, 1, l. 1536. It is 6 plaine 6666, 1111616011
Ι mooted in our temple, and that was this: put case there be three
bretheren‚ John 6 Nokes, John a Nash, and John a Stile: John a

I anm-amus, 86. ΙΙ, 7.-ῙοΝο, Revera ibi est punctum: nam hic

acre, et John a 811166 capit Black-acre et White·acre, en ce cas tout
est void, tout, tout.

In Act II, sc. 8, while Ignoramus and Trico yet tarry, Anto·
nius comes forward uttering threats and with him comes Cupes
blowing his terrorizing horn. Ignoramus in great fright con·
ceals himself behind the mantle 01 1116 new and crafty client,
Trico. When discovered, the lawyer readily promises to press

his suit 101 Rosabella no further. He is accordingly released,
but as he runs hastily away he says, ‘⁴ monstrabo tricem de lege.
