manner in which he takes part in the action in tormenting *Ignoramus
suggest a hidden reference to the parent of the Elizabethan fool,
namely, the Vice of the old morality play, a character which some-
times aided, at the end of the play, in tormenting the devil.

Act V, sc. 3, presents to us Ignoramus in company with his
clerks. He relates how they treated him in the Monastery, and
how he made his escape. He indulges also in threats as to how
he will yet have revenge.

This scene is also new. It may have its conception also in
‘⁴ Twelfth Night,” Act V, sc. 1, in which Malvolio tells Olivia how he
had been dealt with, and utters threats against all his enemies.

In Act V, sc. 4, Trico comes near where Theodorus and
Dorothea are engaged in intimate conversation. The faithful
intriguer is once more dismayed3 for he hears Dorothea assure
her husband that the true Antoninus and the true Gatharine are
tarrying at the port. Theodorus now summons the pretended
Gatharine to appear. Trico draws nearer, that he may overhear
the result of Rosabella’s approaching trial.

This scene just related follows the plot of the latter part of Act V,
Sc. 2, of La Trappolaria. The first part of the scene in the Italian
piece is occupied with the mutual recognition of man and wife after

their fifteen years' separation. In our drama Trico sees Theodorus
and Dorothea already in each other's embrace.

In Act V, sc. 5, Rosabella comes forward and resolutely
asserts that she is Catharine. When however Dorothea proves
the falsity of her claim, the girl bursts into tears, confesses the
entire deception and explains that she is already the wife of
Antonius. Theodorus believing the family name to be dis-
graced through such an alliance, is now thoroughly enraged.
Though Rosabella pleads an honorable origin and purity of
character, nevertheless Theodorus so ladens her with threats,
that she would welcome death.

Act V, Sc. 5, corresponds in fable with the first part of Act V, Sc. 3,
of La Trappolaria. The exposition of the deception, which Rosabella
here gives, is set forth in the Italian piece, in scene 5, by Trappola
himself, when he had accomplished his final purpose.

In Act V, sc. 6, Theodorus entreats Bannacar, his moorish
servant, to put Rosabella to death. The servant objectS, remind-
