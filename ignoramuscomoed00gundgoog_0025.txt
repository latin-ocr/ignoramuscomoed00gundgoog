the first and second prologues there is a character named Davus
Dromo or Musarum Caballus. In the first prologue, in the
form of a hobby-horse‚ he is the only object of ridicule. In the
second prologue this same character is again brought upon the
stage but this time in company with the famous Romanist and
satirist of King J ameS, SchioppiuS. In turn both are tried
before and sentenced by their most hated enemy, the Puritan
IgnoramuS. ΜΓ. Chamberlain, in an account of the king's
first visit, which we reprint in an appendix hereto, states that
‘⁴ David Drummond in a hobby-horse, and Brockyn, the re·
corder of the town, under the name of IgnoramuS, a common
lawyer, bare¹ great parts ”3 and Mr. Hawkins identifies this
character with David Droman, one of the king's fools (edit.
IgnoramuS, p. 11, n. a.). But that this person was a Romanist
and that Ruggle intended to ridicule him and his language as
such will be apparent from the following passages, In the first
prologue Dromo or O'aballus says, “ Quidni ege, qui omnes
linguas calleam, ελληνικὴη, Latinam, Francoise, Castellania,
Italiana, Teuch, Polaski.'' Equiso says of him “ O‘aballus
etiam ecclesiasticus olim, Decanus scilicet de Dunstable.’'
Again Oaballus says of himself, “ Ignoramus enim causidicus
et ego assines sumus ''; and Equiso answers: “ Scite3 ambo
enim barbare loquimini.'' Also in the second prologue Dulman
says of Dromo “ nam olim voluit esse Decanus de Dunstable,''
and Ignoramus puts this question to him, “ Sed, sirrah, num id
verum est, quod tu scribebas in Latino ad Papam facere te
cardinalem ‘P’ From these passages it appears that this char·
acter, Drom0, was no mere clown, as Hawkins asserts but one
who knew a variety of languages and who had at least striven
for ecclesiastical honors. Characters of this name appear in
Kirchmayer’ s “ Pammachius '⁷ and Foxe's “ Christus Trium· ⁴
phane,'' both of which were anti-catholic plays and in both of
which Dromo is an emissary of the devil.

In the drama proper this purpose to ridicule J esuits appears
in various speeches, most prominently in scene II, 3, where
nearly the entire scene is occupied with jesting about J esuit
books and J esuit characters, But the purpose of our author
