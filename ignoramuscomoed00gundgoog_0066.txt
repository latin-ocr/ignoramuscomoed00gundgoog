58 IGNORAMUS.

This scene finds its conception in La Trappolaria, Act V, Sc. 6,
where the tailor comes also, and is kindly received. Vince's speeches,
as in all other scenes of our drama, have no counterpart in the Italian
plece.

Act V, sc. 10, brings Ignoramus and Torcol again upon the
stage. When they hear the full story of Rosabella-Isabella's
life and when the 600 gold pieces are returned to them, they
both relinquish all further claim to Rosabella, and agree to
cause no more interference. However Ignoramus is not allowed
to retire entirely in peace. The boy Vince intersperses all the
speeches of the scene with most sarcastic remarks directed
against the lawyer, and, after several attempts, finally suc-
ceeds in pinning a fox-tail behind the lawyer' 3 back. When
Dulman attempts to defend his master against such insultS,
Vince turns upon him, pelts him with stoneS, and then runs
away.

This scene as well as the two remaining ones have no counterpart
in La Trappolaria. The stone-throwing in this scene, as a means of
contempt, might find its analogy in Timon of AthenS‚ scenes ΙΙΙ, 6,

and IV, 33 but stone-throwing is also a most common incident in
Don Quixote.

Act V, sc. 11, presents Polla in search of Cupes, whom
she had heard to be at the inn in company with Oola and
women of ill-repute. Cupes fears his wife and as 116 3663 1161·
approaching, hides behind the mantle of his confessor, the monk.
The latter promises to deny that he knows anything of his
whereabouts. The Amazon of a woman arriveS, and first
scourges unmercifully the female companions of her husband,
and drives them out of the house. Then in her conversation
with Cola, through open enticement of the monk and her
allusions to their past relations, it becomes very evident that
neither she nor the monk ,3³3ssss of guiltless character. When the
wife has convicted herself, her husband comes forth from his
hiding-place and accuses her. Because both man and wife are
of one stripe, they make peace, and ask the benediction of the
corrupt monk.

In Act V, sc. 12, Cupes and Trico come forward and relate,
