Ι. MANUSORIPTS AND EDITIONS.

Manuscmr‘rs.

Of the drama Ignoramus seven MSS. are preserved at Gam-
bridge, Oxford and in the British Museum. Of these one is
in the library of Clare Hall‚ Cambridge. This MS. is incom-

’ plete. The librarian of Clare Hall informs me that the note of

Mr. Hawkins in reference to its imperfectioris (Hawkins’ Edit.
Igno„ p. lxxiv, note d)1 is quite correct. He adds that the· MS.
bears neither name, date or number. Two MSS. are extant in the
British Museum‘, one among the Harleian collectione No. 6869,
and one in the Sloane collectione, No. 2531. There are also
three in the Bodleian library at Oxford, namely Douce‚ No, 43,
Tanner, No. 306, and Rawl. D. 1361. In connection with the
last named MS. there stands in the catalogue the following
comment, which the librarian has kindly copied and sent me:
“ Very neatly written. It bears this note of original ownership:
‘ Richard Garrard of Southwould owns this booke,' afterwards
it belonged to Archbishop Sancroft‚ and as it contains a list of
the persons originally acting the play, is doubtless the copy
from which he took the list inserted by him in his copy of the
first printed edition, now in the library os Emanuel College.
(See J. S. Hawkins' ed., 17 87 ‚ p. xxii, a.) It has the mistake
of Barges sor the name Bargrave.'' The MS. bears date of
1629. ²

² See full title of this edition beloW, p. 3.

² According to the note of Mr. Hawkins referred to above, it becomes
evident that he derived his names of the actors from Sancroft’s copy of the
first printed edition and not from Bodl. MS. Rawl. D. 1361. It is therefore
almost certain that Hawkins did not consult this MS. for the publication
of his edition3 and since he makes no reference to any of the Oxford
MSS„ it is probable that he was ignorant of all of them, despite the fact
that he speaks of having consulted all the MSS.
