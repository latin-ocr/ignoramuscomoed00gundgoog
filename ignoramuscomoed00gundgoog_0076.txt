It is not yet a fortnight, since
Lutetia entertain’d our prince‚

And vented hath a studied toy
As long as was the siege of Troy,

There must have been also other poems composed by the
Oxford scholars3 for Mr. Chamberlain says, in a second letter,
preserved in the Brit. Mus. among the Birch collection of MSS„
dated 1615, March, while referring to the Oxford men, “ They
have offered at two or three bald ballads‚ which are such poor
stuff they be not worth the looking afterf But I hear they have
it better in a ‘ Freshman's letter to his mother‚' wherein he
relates somewhat handsomely, all that passed.’'

In the year 1662 Ignoramus was translated into English by

to stand for Robert Oodrington, an interpretation which is
based upon the authority of Wood, who in his Athenae Oxo-
menses, Vol. ΙΙ, p. 356, accredits Codrington‚ among 'a list of
other works, with this translation. The title-page reads -as
follows: “ Ignoramus, a Comedy, as it was several Times
acted, with extraordinary Applause, before the Majesty of King
J ames: with a Suppliment‚ which, out of Respect to the Stu-
dents of the Common Law, was hitherto wanting. Written in
Latin by R [G.] RuggleS, sometimes Master of Arts in Clare
College in Cambridge3 and translated into English by R. O„
sometimes Master of Arts in Magdalen College in Oxford.
Lond. 1662.” Copies of this translation are preserved at
Oxford and in the Brit-ish Mus,
