phrase3 both make oaths which they do not hesitate to violate.
Both these mock-heros are thwarted in their passionate love-suit
in practically the same manner. They are alarmed by the
gelder's horn, imprisoned, reported to be possessed of evil spirits,
exorcised and questioned as to their many sins and finally, when
defeated, both threaten to or do appeal to law for justice. Both
these men have also attendants, who like Sancho Panza are in a
manner faithful to their masters, who, nevertheless, are at vari·
ance with them in their views and wrangle with them and who
then, unlike Sancho Panza betray the masters into their enemies'
hands and are themselves cast into prison.

Ignoramus and Hudibras are opposed also by about the same
. number of men and women, between whom in the foregoing com-
parison the following correspondences have been observed.
Rosabella of Ignoramus and the widow of the poem Hudibras
are the obj ects of the sensuality and greed of the two mock-
heros3 Polla of Ignoramus and Trulla of Hudibras are both
lascivious viragos, who chastize vigorously their pretended
lovers, who are the means of placing them in confinement, and
who then report them to be possessed. Trico and Talgol are
both tricksters and leaders of intrigue. Cola in Ignoramus and
Colon in Hudibras are both of the priestly order. Fidicen in
Ignoramus and Orowder0, the fiddler, in Hudibras are both the
victims of abuse. Vince and Orsin both show their detestation
of the respective heroes by throwing stones at them. Also the
horse of Hudibras shows greater likeness to the hobby·horse of
Ignoramus than to Rozinante of Don Quixote. In Ignoramus
and Hudibras both horses are alike strays, which are advertised3
both are monsters, half man, half horse3 both are described in
similar terms3 both are fieet racers3 both are ferocious kickers3
both are for sale. The claim is not here made that these inci·
dents and characteristics were drawn solely from Ignoramus
and were uncontaminated with other sources, not here men·
tioned. We have seen above p. 84 how Butler took the figure
of the astronomer from Mr. Tompkin' s comedy entitled Albu-
mazar, the Astrologer, surrounded him with furies and hob-
goblins and then causes them to perform a service very similar
