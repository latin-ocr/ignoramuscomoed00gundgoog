to decide which was the true townsman, whether he that sat by,
or he who acted on the stage. Sit still they could not for
chafing, go out they could not for crowding‚ but, impatiently
patient, were fain to attend till dismissed at the end of the
comedy. The mayor and his brethren soon after complain of
this libellous play to the lords of the Privy O'ouncil, and truly
aggravate the scholar's offence, as if the mayor’ s mace could
not be played with but that the scept-re itself is touched therein.
Now, though such the gravity of the lords, as they must main-
tain magistracy, and not behold it abused: yet such their good-
ness, they would not with too much severity punish wit, though
waggishly employed3 and therefore only sent some slight and
private check to the principal actors therein. There goeth a
tradition, many earnestly engaging for the truth thereos, that
the townsmen, not contented herewith, importunately pressed,
that some more severe and public punishment might be inflicted
upon them. Hereupon, the lords promised in short time to
come to Cambridge3 and, because the life in such things is
lacking when only read, they themselves would see the same
comedy, with all the properties thereof, acted over again (the
townsmen, as formerly, being enjoined to be present thereat),
that so they might the better proportion the punishment to the
fault, if any appeared. But rather than the townsmen would
be witnesses again to their own abusing (wherein many things
were too far from—and some things too near to—truth) they ·
fairly fell off from any farther prosecution of the matter.'' ⁴

From the fact that in this drama, the language of the towns-
men was ridiculed, as also from the title itself, we may infer
that it was a play in purpose and character similar to Igno-
ramus. Moreover it is asserted that the same Francis Brackyn
referred to above, and who at this time was deputy·recorder of
Cambridge, was also in “ Olub Law '' one of the leading char·
acters ridiculed.1 We may be sure therefore that the per·
formance of “ Olub Law,'' together with the incidents of Cam-
bridge life preceding and following it must have produced a
