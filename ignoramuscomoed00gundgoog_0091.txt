They might distinguish different noise
of horns and pans and dogs and boys.

ΙΙ, 11, 609 :

First he that led the cavalcate

Wore a sow-gelders flagellate,

On which he blew as strong a levet

When over one another’s heads

Again by the monks, dressed as goblins (chap. 37). In Satyrs Menippee
the Advocato general was imprisoned in a cloister (see Sat. Men„ Edit.
Ratisbone, 1714, pp. 129 and 189 ff). In “Merry Wives of Windsor”
Falstaff was stuffed into a clothes-hamper. Imprisonment would be a mo-
