44 IGNORAMUS.

Quoniam juravi, non ibo ipse, sed mittam clericum meum Dul-
man pro Rosabella.'' The three accomplices laugh heartily.
Trico now recommends Antonius to take precaution agaixnst a
new danger, and have a birth-mark painted upon his cheek, so
that he may be ready to play the role of his London brother
AntoninuS, in case he should meet his father.

This scene also, like the two preceding ones, is original. The horn,
as instrument of terror, is used in Don Quixote, Part Ι, Chapters Π
and XLI ; also several times in the second part.

For the gelding motive‚ so prominent in this scene, compare Return

from Parnassus, Pt. ΙΙ, Act H, Sc. 3, 1. 656; also Middleton's Blurt,
ΙΙ, ΙΙ, 631).

In Act III, sc. 1, Trico remains and receives Dulman, who
at once appears with the signed contract and money for Rosa-
bella. Trico represents himself to be Torcol’s servant, and suc-
cessfully entertains the messenger, while Cupes attires himself
to play the role of Torcol.

The scene just described is in fable similar to Act III, Sc. 1, of La
Trappolaria. The following speeehae have verbal similarity.

Dent. Veggio un giovane, lo di· Dal. Video unum ib1, demandab0‚
mandere. etc.

Dent. . . . Ο huomo da bene! Dul. . . . Oh honeste vir!

Trap. Come ti chiami? Trico Quid tibi itidem?

Trap. Conosci tu questa da che Trica . . . at scin' cujus sit haee
mano e scritta? scriptio?

Dent. Conosco benissimo, Del Dul. Est manus mei magistri.
Capitan. Dragoleone. Dul. Sed quaeso jam clama magis·

Dent. Chiama il tuo padrone, che trum tuum huc, ad dandum mihi
mi consegni la donna. liberaturum Rosabellae.

Act III, sc. 2, adds Gupes to the company of the preceding
one. He comes forth having his neck twisted and is also dressed
like Torcol. He talks Portuguese with his servant, Trico; and
these two so thoroughly deceive Dulman, that he delivers over to
them the money, the contract and the secret sign, whereby Torcol
was to know the true servant of Ignoramus They treat Dul-
man plentifully to wine, and Cupes implores him to have an
oversight, that Rosabella-Polla shall be well treated at the
hands of his master.
