LITERARY mammon. 67

Argument against Sir Ignoramus of Cambridge, by Robert
Callis, of Gray' s Inn, Esquire, afterward Sergeant at Law, in
his Reading at Staples Inn in Lent, 14 J a. R„ 4to. Lond.
1648.''

It is also not improbable that Selden’s “ History of Tithes,'’
printed in 1617, was composed in a spirit of retaliation for
Ruggle's Ignoramus. Fuller, in his “ Church History,'’ Book
X, p. 71, gives as his authority for such an opinion the author
of Dr. Preston’s life. Fuller however says in reference to it,
he ‘⁴ cannot suspect so high a soul guilty of so low reflectione
that his book related at all to this occasion3 but only that the
latitudo of his mind, tracing all paths of learning, did casually
light on the road of this subject. (Hawkins' edit. Ign0., p.
lxv, note b.) However the author of “A Discourse concerning

Ridicule and Irony in Writing, in a Letter to the reverend Dr.
Nathanael Marshall,” printed in 8v0, Lond., 1729, refers, page
14, to the tradition of such retaliation as being current. ”

The success of the muses of Cambridge in their entertain-
ment of the king seems to have incited rival muses at Oxford
also to the composition of several poems derogatory to Cam-
bridge and her entertainment. A poem, known as the Oxford'
ballad‚ was composed in Latin, presumably by Oxford students
after the first performance of Ignoramus and sung in derision
at the second presentation by the Cambridge scholars. This
poem in the original seems to be no longer extant3 but an Eng-
lish translation of it, accredited to bishop Corbet, is still pre-
served. (See Corbet's Poems, edit. 1628, p. 29.)¹ It con·
sists of twenty-six six-line strophies and is entitled, “A grave
Poem, as it was presented in Latin by certain Divinae before
his majesty in Cambridge, by way of Intcrlude, styled “ Liber
novus de Adventu Regis Cantabrigiam.” Faithfully done into
English, with some liberal advantage: made rather to be sung
than read, to the tune of “ Bonny Nell.’' The poem begins
thus:
