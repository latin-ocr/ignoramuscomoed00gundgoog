III. MOTIVES AND PURPOSES.

As the primary motive for the composition of the drama be·
fore uS, J. S. Hawkins in the introduction to his edit-ion 01
Ignoramus, Fleay in his Chronicle 01 the English Drama, and
others assign a dispute which as they say arose about the be-
ginning of the year 1611, as to whether the mayor of Cambridge
or the vice chancellor of the university were entitled in certain
cases to precedence. It is further stated, that in the conduct
of the suit resulting from this controversy, a certain Francis
Brackyn, a common lawyer and at· that time recorder 01 Cam·
bridge, took such an active part on behalf of the mayor, that he
incurred the bitter odium of the vice chancellor and his friends;
and that for this reason he was ridiculed by Ruggle in the char-
acter of Ignoramus A. W. Ward in his History of English
Dramatic Literature, edit. 187 5, expresses practically the same
sentiment, but in the recent edition of his work, he speaks of
the strife between mayor and vice chancellor as being older
than 1611, and yet seems to imply that the drama was composed
designedly for the entertainment 01 the king and that within
a short time previous to his first visit to Cambridge. He says:
“ He it was,'' referring to Brackyn, “ whom, for the delectation
01 King J ames on an unexpected royal visit to Cambridge, the

ingenious Ruggle resolved to make the hero of a Latin
’ comedy.’'1 It is indeed certain that Brackyn waS, justly or
unjustly, taken as the model for Ignoramus3 yet Ruggle's pur-
pose was certainly more comprehensive than the ridicule of a
single individual. Musaeus sayS, act. ΙΙ., sc. 6, “possem, si
opus, infinitos celebrare ordinis hujus virOS.’' Mr. J. Β. Μ111-

² There is nothing in the comedy itself which gives any elue to the time

. 01 composition or the length 01 time used in its preparation. The only

clue which I have found is in the Essays 01 John Stephens‚ 2d edit„ p. 31,
where he says: “ Who cannot lay matter in two years 101· a ragged play? ''
Even 11 this two years be those immediately preceding the first per·
formance 01 Ignoramus in 1615, the causes which called forth the comedy
were not limited to that time.
