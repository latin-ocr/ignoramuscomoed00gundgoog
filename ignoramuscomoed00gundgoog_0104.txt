96 IGNORAMUS.

wishes to express when he says, “ The machinery 'is closely
modellcd upon Don Quixote'' (see above, p. 72). The char-
acters and purposes of Don Quixote and Hudibras are entirely
dissimilar. The ideas, style, and language of the two works are
also entirely independent of each other. No adventure or inci-
dent in Hudibras bears more likeness to Don Quixote than one
adventure in Don Quixote bears to another. Of any incident in
Hudibras the most we can say of it is that it is Quixotic, that is,
after the manner of Don Quixote.

Although I have referred in notes to several points of possible
similarity between Satyre Menippee and Hudibras3 neverthe-
less, following the precedent of all the principa} historians of
English literature, I pass by this influence as an insignificant
one. The similarity of none of the incidente is very great, and
the general plan and form of the two works are totally different.
Hudibras is a narrative poem3 Satyre Menippee consists of a
series of harangues written in prose interspersed with short
poems. In these there is not one principa] figure as in Eudi-
bras but several. The two works are alike principally in this,
that they are both politico-religious satires, full of the spirit of
mockery and scorn.

As the prototype of HudibraS, the large, corpulent old sinner
I have proposed in the foregoing notes Shakespeare's figure of

Falltllssilitler derived the first notion for his composite picture of

Hudibras from Don Quixote, and if he derived from Falstaff
the outward form, the figure, the licentious fool-character of
Hudibras3 he derived from Ignoramus his legal character, his
pedanticism and his jargon-speaking tendency. Of Butler's in-
debtedness to Ignoramus for the characterization and action of
his poem we may summarize in brief the observed points of our
foregoing comparison. We have observed that both Ignoramus
and Hudibras are pedantic, foolish, consciencelesS, legal char-
acters, who use a common jargon3 both are despisers of academie
learning: both are sensual lovers, who propose to marry for

money3 both direct letters to their ladies couched in legal
¹ For this suggestion I am indebted to Professor Wolfgang Keller.
