24 IGNORAMUS.

Roman-Italian comedies in the Plautine·Ariosto style. This
comedy combines various elements borrowed from different
comedies of Plautus, principally the Pseudolus the Menaechmi
and the Epidicus. It was first published at Bergamo in Lom-
bardy, 1596, and was reprinted at Venice the following year,
1597. Of sources other than La Trappolaria to which the au·
thor of Ignoramus was indebted the most important are (1)
“ Pedantius,’' a Latin drama enacted at Cambridge, probably as
early as 1581. (See Sinith, edit. Ped., p. x3 also Churchill
and Keller's· Universit‘atsdramen, Shakespeare J ahrbuch‚ Bd.
XXXIV, p. 256.) (2) Cervantes' mock heroic romanoe, Don
Quixote, of which the first edition appeared, in 1605, at
Madrid3 and of which a translation into English appeared at
London, 16133 the very time at which Ruggle was in all prob-
ability beginning the composition of his comedy. (See above,
p. 10, note.) (3) The Pilgrimage to Parnassus and The Re-
turn from Parnassus, in two partS. (See above, p. 13.)
Several dramas of Shakespeare, to which we refer under com-
parison, contributed also in all probability to Ruggles stock of
wit and types3 but a direct influence is not easy to establish.

The first prologue presents to us three characters: first, a
hobby-horse named Caballus Musarum or Davus Drom03 and,
secondly, Cursor and Equis0, who are commissioned by the
Muses to seek for this Caballian horse, which had made his
escape and was not to be found.. When at last Caballus is cap-
tured and subdued, he at once insists upon leading the pro·
logue, for which ambitious claim he is sharply ridiculed by
Cursor and Equis0.

Whoever this Davus Dromo was or whatever class of men
he represented, the purpose of the entire prologue is to thor-
oughly burlesque him. It is said of him, “ Homo fuit: sed cum
homo non magis saperit quam caballus, iratae Musae, quas
vexabat indies, mutarunt eum in Caballinum hominem.'' N ot-
withstanding this he knew many languages, and appears once
to have sought ecclesiastica] preferment. He is treated with
