OOMPARISON WITH LA TRAPPOLARIA. 41

While Trico yet tarries, Cupes appears, in Act ΙΙ, sc, 3,
proclaiming his wareS, “ Libelli, belli, belli, novi libelli 1''
Trico greets him and makes many a jest concerning his books,
mostly J esuit ones. After this, in consideration of eight gulden,
Cupes promises first of all to induce his amazon-like wife,
Polla, to be sent to Ignoramus in place of Rosabella3 and in
the next place that he himself will represent the part of Torcol
(so named because of his wry neck) and thus deceive the mes-
senger of Ignoramus, when he should appear for Rosabella3 or
in case Ignoramus should come for her in person, frighten him
away with a gelders horn. Trico and Antonius go away to a
tailor, to secure costumes necessary for the deception.

The object to be attained in this scene is the same as that in La
Trappolaria, Act ΙΙ, Sc. 3. However, the two scenae have little verbal
or thought correspondence. In each we have the comical dialogue
between the parasite and the wily servant, yet while the first half of
the scene in our work is occupied with jesting about books, in La
Trappolaria there are lengthy remarks concerning eating and drink-
ing; in Ignoramus there is no necessity of persuasion, as in La
Trappolaria, to induce Oupes to represent Torcol, for in the preceding
scene Trico says, ‘⁴ Oupes se mihi operam daturam promisit hodie.”
The talk in the latter part of our scene is rather concerning Polla,
and whether she can be induced to represent Rosabella. The idea of
passing in review the books referred to in this scene is probably bor·
rowed from the condemnation and destruction of Don Quixote's

library by the curate and barber (cf. Don Q„ Chap. VI),
Act II, sc. 4, transfers us to the house of Cupes‚ where he

. calls his wife. Polla raises her voice and answerS, “ Polla,

Polla? Quid vociferare adeo? numnam ebrius esP' The two
quarrel, and in turn jest with each other about eating‚ drinking
and marital happiness. Polla will hear nothing of playing
the role of another man' s wife, but finally, when Cupes gives
her two gulden and promises her that he will bring no mistress
into the house during her absence, she consents.

Both this scene just related, and Act ΙΙ, Sc. 4, of La Trappolaria,
present to us the picture of men persuading their wives to act, for
the time being, the part of another man's wife. Both women yield
when a share of the booty is offered them. Though similar in plan,
there is almost no verbal similarity between the two scenes.
