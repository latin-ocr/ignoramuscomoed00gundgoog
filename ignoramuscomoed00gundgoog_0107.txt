Mr. Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Oarleton, at Turin.

My very ,qood lov-d,

Ι am newly returned from Cambridge, whither Ι went some two
days after Ι wrote you my last. The king made his entry there the
seventh of this present, with as much solemnity and concourse of
gallants and great men, as the hard weather and extreme foul ways
would permit. The prince came along with him, but not the queen,
by reason, as it is said, that she was not invited: which error is rather
imputed to their Ohancellor than to the Scholars, that understand
not these courseS. Another defect was that there were no embassa·
ἀοι-ε, which, no doubt, was upon the same reason; but the absence of
women may be the better excused for default of language, there being
few or none present but of the HowardS, or that alliance; as the
countess of Arundel, with her sister the lady Elizabeth Grey3 the
countess of Suffolk, with her daughters of Salisbury and Somerset;
the lady Walden, and Henry Howard’s wife3 which were all that Ι
remember. The lord treasurer kept there a very great port and mag-
nificent table, with the expense of a thousand pounds a day, as is
said, but that seems too large an allowance ; but sure his provisions
were very great, besides plenty of presents, and may be in some sort
estimated by his proportion of wine, whereof he spent twenty-six tun
in five days. He lodged and kept his table at St. J ohn's college, but
his lady and her retinue at Magdalen college, whereof his grand-
father Audley was founder. The king and prince lay at Trinity
college, where the plays were represented; and the hall so well ordered
for room, that above two thousand persons were conveniently placed.
The first night's entertainment was a comedy, and acted by St. J ohn's
men, the chief part consisting of a counterfeit Sir Edward Ratcliffe,
a foolish tutor of physic, which proved but a lean argument; and
though it were larded with pretty shews at the beginning and end,
and with somewhat too broad speech for such a presence, yet it was
still dry. The second night was a comedy of Clare hall, with the
help of two or three good actors from other houses, wherein David
Drummond‚ in a Hobby-horse, and Brakin, the recorder of the town,
under the name of Ignoramus, a common lawyer, bare great parts.
The thing was full of mirth and variety, with many excellent actors
