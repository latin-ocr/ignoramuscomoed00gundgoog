linger in his History of Cambridge University has shown that
this contention as to supremacy of mayor or vice chancellor had
on several previous occasions been disputed, and already in the
year 1601 decided by the Earl of Essex in favor of the vice
chancellor3 and also that st-rife between the town and univer-
sity was chronic: and further that Brackyn had, for years first
as deputy recorder and later as recorder of Cambridge, taken
an active interest in these controversies.¹ We may believe
therefore that earlier events incident to this strife exerted as
great, possibly greater influence upon the composition of
Ruggle’s drama than the contest of 1611. At any rate there
are several pieoes of literature, which in their relation to Cam-
bridge life and our author must not be neglected, to be taken into
consideration. As early as the year 1598, the same year in
which Ruggle became a fellow of Clare Hall, there was enacted
at this same college a drama entitled, “ Club Law,'' the author·
ship of which is generally accredited to Ruggle’s hand, and of
which Fuller, in his University of Cambridge (edit. 1840, p.
218), gives the following interesting account:

“ The young scholars, conceiving themselves somewhat

not), ‘betook them for revenge to their wits, as the weapon

covery of some town-privacies from Mr. Goldsborough, one of
their own corporation, composed a merry (but abusive) comedy
(which they called ‘⁴ Club Law ''), in English, as calculated
for the capacities of such, whom they intended spectators
thereos. Clare Han was the place wherein it was acted3 and
the mayor, with his brethren, and their wiveS, were invited to
‚behold it, or rather themselves abused therein. A convenient
place was assigned to the townsfolk (riveted in with scholars
on all sides), where they might see and be seen. Here they
did behold themselves in their own best clothes (which the
scholars had borrowed), so lively personated, their habits, ges-
