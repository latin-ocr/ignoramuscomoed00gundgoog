LITERARY mFLUENon. 85

‘ of Butler's poem, or which Ignoramus suffers in Sc. IV, 5, of

Ruggle's drama. Α

9. Ignoramus and Hudibras both, when defeated and perse-
cuted, propose to seek justice through the law. Compare Igno·
ramus, Scs. IV, 8 and 93 and Hudibras, III, 111, 1. 373—120 end
. of canto.

Dulman, M usaeuS, Pecus—RalphO.

Attendants respectively to Ignoramus and Hudibras.

1. Dulman, the clerk of Ignoramus, and Ralpho, the squire
attendant upon Hudibras, are both caricatured as “ dull men,”
and treated by their masters as such.

Ignoramus, Sc. IV, 7 τι·
Es magnus vitulus vocatus a great cali—Dixit? etiam talis lobba, Dul-

man t Dulman revera—Hanga, hanga 3 putabam quod Musaeus 'erat
major asinus quam tu3 sed tu es major asinus quam unus universitans.

Hudibras, Ι, 1, 479:

His knowledge was not far behind

The Knight’s, but of another kind,

And he another way came by 'tt

Some call it gifts and some New-light3
A liberal art that cost no pains

of study, industry, or brains

His wit was sent him for a token,

But in the carriage crack’d and broken.

2. Dulman and Ralpho are both, in a sense, faithful to their
respective masters and defend them against assaults of their
enemies. Compare Ignoramus, Scs. Ι, 3; IV, 11, and V, 10.
Hudibras, e. 9., Ι, 11, 11. 825 ff. and 945 ff.

3. Dulman and Ralpho, however, both quarrel with their
respective masters. Compare IgnoramUS, Sc. IV, 7. HudibraS,
II, 11, in particular ll. 541-584.

4. Musaeus, another clerk of Ignoramus, and Ralpho, the
squire, both complain of the treatment or consideration, which
they receive at the hands of their respective masters, ridicule
their views, and betray them into the hands of their enemies,
by informing the same of their approach in order to claim the

² Sancho Panza of Don Quixote was probably, either directly or indi·
rectly a prototype for both Dulman of Ignoramus and Ralpho of Hudibras.
