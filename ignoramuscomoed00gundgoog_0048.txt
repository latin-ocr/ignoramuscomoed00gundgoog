stage, and gives directions preparatory to the departure of
Antonius The latter in submission to his father's will, yet in
great anguish of spirit, 33113 for England. He 3393, “ Fiet,
Vale Pater,'' then aside “ ad mortem ege, nisi Trico—.''

The conversation between Theodorus and Trico at the beginning
of this scene, bears similarity to the lively conversation between
Oallifrone and Trappola in the sixth scene of La Trappolaria, yet the
entire scene has been in our drama greatly condensed, and not more
than six short speeches have any verbal likeness to the original.

In Act II, sc. 1, Theodorus rejoices, that 1113 3011 13 safely
at sea, and that everything has been accomplished according to
his wish. He then turns to his old servant Bannacar and
piously reminds him what a debt of gratitude he owes his master,
who had been the means of converting him from Mohamedanism
to the Christian religion, then in the spirit of a hard task-
master says to him: “i nunc intro igitur, tibi mandata ut
geras '⁷ ; then aside 113 adds, “ usque exerceat opere.''

The rather lengthy monologue of the old Callifrone in La Trap-
polaria‚ Act 11, Sc. 2, is by our author condensed to the first four
verses of the scene just narrated. The exchange of remarks between
Theodorus and Bannacar has no counterpart in the Italian drama,

The idea of conversion from Mohamedenism to Christianity, which

appears in this scene and also in scene V, 6, is rather a prominent
incident of . Don Quixote. See in particular Chaps. XV and XXXI.

Trico had followed with a skiff the vessel, overtaken it, and
brought back to land his master AntoniuS, wh0‚ though pleased‚

shows at once in Act II, sc. 2 anxiety as to how they may get ,

possession of Rosabella. Trico promises that, through the
assistance of OuPeS, a book vender, and some money, he can
accomplish this 3130. Antonius gives his benefactor ten gulden
which his father had given him for the voyage„

The plan of procedure, which is set forth in detail by Trappola in
Act H, Sc. 2, of the Italian drama, and which is there practically the
same as the plan of the Pseudolus of PlautuS, is here in this scene
of our drama not fully divulged. TricO, the master of intrigue, only
reveals his plan as the occasion demands In this respect he re-
sembles Pseudolus rather than Trappola. This scene in our drama
is, therefore, abbreviated from five pages in the Italian piece to one.
The similarity of expression is slight.
