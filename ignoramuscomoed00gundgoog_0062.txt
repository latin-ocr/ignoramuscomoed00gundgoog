54 IGNORAMUS.

In Act IV, sc. 12, Trico and Antonius come before us and
are at once dismayed to see Pyropus, accompanied by constables,
drawing near for their arrest. When seized both Trico and An-
tonius deny that they have any acquaintance with each other.
Trico is released because of his assurances to the tailor. An-

tonius is about to be carried away to prison, but when he realizes
that all will be lost, if this happen‚ he draws his sword, frees
himself and puts his enemies to flight.

The plan of this scene is, on the whole, the same as that of Act IV,
Sc. 12, of La Trappolaria. However, it is, as ever, executed in an·
other manner. The following speeches have some verbal likeneSS.

wife of Theodorus, accompanied by Antoninus and Catharine,
does now actually arrive from London. Owing to the ill-effects
of the voyage upon O‘atharine‚ she and Antoninus remain at
the harbor, while Dorothea, accompanied by two attendants„
Nell her maid and Vince her page, proceeds to seek her hus-
band's house in Bordeaux, While the wife anxiously awaitS, in
his drawing room, her husband's appearance, Vince indulges in
vulgar jesting with Nell.

The first ten· verses of this scene are a condensation of Sc. V, 1,
of La Trappolaria. The remainder of this scene, as also the follow·

ing, consist in a dialogue between Vince and Nell, which are new
characters and whose conversation has no counterpart in the Italian
source.

Act V, sc. 2, Vince and Nell continue their jokes until they
see Ignoramus approaching, when Vince exclaims: “ Go, yonder
comes a mad man.''

This scene is original. Vince is the type of fool common to Shake-

speare and other Elizabethan dramatists. Both his name and the ⁸
