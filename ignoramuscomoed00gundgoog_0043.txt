In Act Ι, sc⁴ 2, Antonius appears on the stage, laments in a
soliloquy his fate and relates the details of his love3 Rosabella,
of whom he is violently enamoured, is the daughter of a Portu-

of his brother Rodrigo Torcol. The latter, having been reduced
to poverty through misfortune, was now conducting at Bordeaux
a common brothel. However, that he might sell Rosabella to
better advantage, he had had respect to her rank and chastity.
His price for her was 600 gulden, which sum, out of love for
the girl, and an honorable desire to free her from a disreputable
home, Antonius had promised to pay: but because he could not

was tarrying at BordeauX, and who readily promised to pay for
the girl the sum desired.
