 

V. IGNORAMUS: COMPARISON WITH LA TRAP-
POLARIA, AND OTHER SOUROES.

In order to establish the degree of our author' s originality, a
comparison of his drama with its sources will now be necessary.

A manuscript, No. 980, of the Harleian collection, page 161,
contains a memorandum in the following words,¹ “ The comedy
of Ignoramus, so abusive against lawyers, and supposed to be
made by Mr. Ruggell, of Clare Hall, in Cambridge, is but a
translation of a comedy by Baptist Porta, out of Italian, in-
tituled TrapulariO, as may be seen by the comedy itself, extant
in Clare Hal] library, with notes of Mr. Ruggell' s thereon of
his contriving and altering thereof.’'

Mr. J. S. Hawkins, who examined this copy of Trappolaria
in Clare Hall, establishes the inaccuracy of this statement, by
asserting that the notes in this copy are only eleven in number,
and that they have nothing to do with the altering of the work.²
He also points out that the author of this memorandum, in all
probability based his statement principally upon the following
note written on the leaf preceding the title page of this same
copy of La Trappolaria “ Oomedia multo piena di Trappolaria,
da chi fu tradotta la comedia, intotolata Ignoramo, composta
dal ingeniosimo huomini [ingeniosissimo huomo] maestro
Georgio Ruggle, socio del collegio di Olar,'’ etc„ signed J. J.

La Trappolaria did indeed furnish the author of Ignoramus
the main features of plot, but to name Ruggle' s drama a trans-
lation, would be to rob its author of that ingenuity, which the
writer of the note just quoted attributes to him and which he
deserves.

La Trappolaria was composed by the celebrated Italian scien-
tist and writer Giam-Battista della Porta, who was at the be-
ginning of the seventeenth century the foremost writer of
