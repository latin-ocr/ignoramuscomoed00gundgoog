72 IGNORAMUS.

Oervantes hatte er kein Gefiihl und keinen Verstand. Wo ist
hier jener edle gemiitsw'arme Idealismus, der durch alle Toll-
heiten und Verkehrtheiten Don Quixote's so liebenswiirdig hin-
durchschimmert und ihm immer und iiberall herzliche Theil-
nahme sichert? Sir Hudibras und* Ralf sind vom Anfang bis
zum Ende elende und gemeine Lumpe, auf die alle Thorheiten
und Laster geladen sind, die nur jemals die Cavaliere den
Rundkiipfen schuld gaben.''

Mr. Richard Garnett, one of the most recent of English his-
torians says: “ Butler’s Hudibras may perhaps be best defined
as a metrical parody upon Don Quixote, with a spice of allusion
to the Faerie Queene, in which the nobility and pathos of the
originals are designedly obliterated, and the humor exaggerated
into farce, to suit the author’s polemic purpose.'' . . . “ The
machinery is closely modelled upon Don Quixote.'' (Age of
Dryden‚ Lond., 1901, p. 58.)

Mr. W. J. Oourthope, on the other hand, would seem, like
most of German historiam, to deny to Hudibras in all essentials
much influence from Don Quixote. (See History of English
Poetry‚ Lond., 1903, Vol. ΙΙΙ, p. 358.)

I ymramw a Sourcc for H udibras.

It is apparent from these excerpts that they all are of the
most general character and that there is among -critics little
definiteness or unanimity of opinion as to how much influence
should be accredited to any of the sources yet named. Ι pro-
ceed therefore to present the claims of the comedy Ignoramus
as a source from which Butler drew for the characterization and
action of his poem. The popularity of Ignoramus and the prob-
ability that Butler studied at Cambridge make it almost cer· ⁴
tain that the comedy was well known to him. Naturally in two
works so radically different in form, great verbal likeness is
scarcely to be looked for. It is the spirit of the actorS, and the
motives prompting them rather than speeches which are to ‘be
compared3 motives and characteristics which are little more
than suggested in the drama of Ruggle are, as we should ex-
pect, in Butler's epic elaborated at great length and sometimes
