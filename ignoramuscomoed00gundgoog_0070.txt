for La Trappolaria) of PlautuS, where Ballio, scene 2, lashes
his slaves for the delectation of Calidorus, In scene Ι, 5, like
Pedantius he pleads in motley speech his cause before the fair
Rosabella. In soenes ΙΙ, 6 and 7 Musaeus, the representative
of the University, probably the Philomusus of the Parnassus
dramaS, ridicules and helps to baffie this enemy of school, state
and church. In scene ΙΙ, 8, Trico and Cupes threaten to cas·
trate this arch-deceiver. In scene ΙΙΙ, 8, aside from the quarrel
of words as it is in La Trappolaria, this ardent lover is, because
of his strangely mixed language, like Don Quixote, imputed to
be mad and possessed, and receives in true Quixotic style a sound
trouncing at the hands of the infuriated Polla. In soenes IV,
10 and 11 this unfortunate lover is again like Don Quixote
attacked by Gola, the monk, and exorcised according to the rites
of the Roman church and the custom of the time. In scene V,
3, Ignoramus gives his clerks Dulman and Pecus an account
of these experiences. In scene V, 10, he is further tormented
and made ridiculous by Vince, the fool.

Cupes, according to our comparison, page —, corresponds to
Fagone of La Trappolaria, but in Ignoramus he is not merely
a parasite, who delights only in eating3 he is also a vender of
books, whose conversation with Trico about his wareS, sc. II, 3,
reminds us of the condemnation of Don Quixote's library by
the priest and barber. The hilarity of this character at the
inn, sc. ΙΙΙ, 10, by reason of his contemplated feast with his
friendS, his songs with musical accompaniment, his jests at
his wife's expense and finally the trouncing, which he and
the musicians receive at the hands of the Amazonian Polla,
have no counterpart in La Trappolaria, This scene is also
largely Quixotic. Cupes as the companion and assistant of the
monk seems to bear, throughout the play, the same relation to
Oola as the barber did to the priest in Don Quixote (see below

under Cola, p. 63).

Musaeus as the representative of the university and the arts
has no equivalent in La Trappolaria, but seems to have been
