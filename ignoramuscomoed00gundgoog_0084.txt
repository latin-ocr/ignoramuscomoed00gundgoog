76 IGNORAMUS.

IynoranvuS, the Lawyer—Hudibras, the K niyhffl

1. We first observe that Hudibras ie, not only like Don Quix-
ote, a knight‚ but is also like Ignoramus‚ a legal character. That
he exercised legal functione, the following passages will serve

as illustration.
Hudibras, Ι, 1, 23:

Great on the bench, great in the saddle,
That could as well bind o'er as swaddle;

Hudibras, I, 1, 713:

And therefore thus bespoke the Squire
We that are wisely mounted higher

² The portrait of Hudibras, the Knight, is a composite, in which the
characteristics of more than one personage are discernable. Dr. Johnson is
right, when he says “ the author seems to labour with a tumultuous con-
fusion of dissimilar ideas '’ (“ Lives of the Poets ”) . The name of this
so-called Knight is found in Spencer's Faerie Queene, Bk. ΙΙ, canto II, 17.
It was without doubt Cervantes’ picture of Don Quixote, with his horse
Rozinante and his ignorant Sancho Panza, which Butler chose first of
all as a model for his portrait of Hudibras and Ralpho ; when once
Butler has sketched a mere outline, he looked away from that copy and
began to fill in with features derived from various sources ς so that in the
completed composite picture of Hudibras all the manly features of Don
Quixote had been obliterated. Don Quixote was, according to his concep·
tion of Knight·errantry, a true Knight3 Hudibras is in reality no Knight 3
he is a sectarian religionist, a justice of the peace, a rogue. For the figure
of Hudibras in the character of rogue Butler evidently drew from Shake-
spear’s portrait of Sir John Falstaff, as he appears in Henry IV and “ The
Merry Wives of Windsor.” Falstaff is the prototypo for Hudibras in
vastness of body, in cowardliness and lasciviousness.

The Satyre Menippee has also a character not unlike Hudibras in the
person of Monsieur C. Lieutenant (see Sat. Men„ Edit. Ratisbone, 1714,
p. 181).

Nearly all historians of English literature recognize as a fact the tradi·
tion, that Butler drew his picture of Hudibras from the person and char·
acter of Sir Samuel Luke, in whose house Butler is believed to have lived
for a time. This tradition first found expression in print fifty years after
the appearance of Hudibras, in a key to the poem, attributed to Sir Roger
L'Estrange, which was printed with Butler’s posthumous works 1715. Ι
shall not controvert this tradition 3 it may be noted however that if it is
true, Butler has intentionally perverted several facts 3 first by making
“ The great spirited little Sir Samuel Luke '⁹ (see Dict. Nat. Biog.) into a
cowardly Giant ; secondly by placing the scene of the poem in the West-
land, Butler's native section, while the home of Luke was in Bedfordshire
towards the East. (See Hudibras, I, 1, 665.)
