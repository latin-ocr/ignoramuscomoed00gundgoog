ΙΙ. REPRESENTATIONS.

Special interest and importance are connected with the
first and second representation of our drama through the
fact that both presentations were given within a short time
of each other for the delectation of King J ames Ι. Prob-
ably from the time that the king made his first progress
towards the capital, when at Hinchingbrook he promised
the heads of the university his favor, had Cambridge schol·
ars hoped for a visit from his Royal Majesty. After twelve
years of vain expectancy and after the king had in the mean-
while paid two visits to Oxford, one in 1605, and another in
1614, Cambridge men were emboldened to send his majesty
through their distinguished, newly-chosen chancellor‚ Thomas
Howard‚ Earl of Suffolk, and Lord Treasurer of England, an
invitation to grace also Cambridge with his royal presence.
(Baker’s MSS. collectione, British Museum‚ Vol. XII, p.
159.)¹ This visit being urged also by Carr‚ the earl of Somer-
set, the king graciously accepted the invitation and promised
to make the visit between Christmas and the following Shrove-
’ tide, 1614-15. (Sir Fulke Greville's “ Five Years' of King
James,'' edit. 4to, 1643, p. 60.)2 However because of the great
snow-storms of that winter and the inclemency of the weather
the king and his train did not arrive in Cambridge until the
seventh of March. (Hawkins' edit. Ignoramus, pp. xxv-xxvi.)

A program of the evening entertainments provided for the
king's visit is as follows:

On Tuesday, the ’ἲ th of March 1614 (15), was acted before the king

. in Trinity College hall,

1. Amelia, a Latin comedy made by Mr. Cecil J ohannis.

On Wednesday night, ·

2. Ignoramus, the lawyer, Latine, and part English, composed by
Mr. Ruggle, Clarensis.
