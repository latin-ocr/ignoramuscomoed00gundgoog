the Monk and his exorciserS. There is in this scene almost no verbal
likeness with the Italian piece.

In Act IV, sc. 10, Trico, Cupes, and 0013, 1οᾶ by Polla,
appear, to the great relies of Antonius. Polla designates
Ignoramus as the demoniac, and says that Torcol is also an-
other os the same stamp. Theodorus believes the story, and,
accompanied by Antonius and Rosabella, retires within the
house. The exorcisers then lay hold upon Ignoramus. Torcol
is frightened and flees.

In Act IV, sc. 11, they bind Ignoramus to a chair‚ and
frighten away Dulman by a threat to exorcise him also, They
regard the lawyer' s remonstranceS, always uttered in his char-
acteristic J argon, as additional evidence of his being thoroughly
possessed. In punishment of every Latin law-phrase, wjaich the
lawyer introduces into his speeches‚ they apply to him the
rigorous rites of exorcism‚ as though they were so many evil
spirits. Because he does not yield to the treatment, but still
remains incorrigible, 0013, the monk, bids him to be conveyed
away to his monastery, where he may receive more extreme
treatment. Because of the brave part which Cupes had taken
against the lawyer, his wife's calumniator, Polla is proud of
him, and man and wife go away to the inn together, reunited
in the bonds of peace.

Scenes 10 and 11, which we have just described seem indeed to be
original. Exorcism was one of the most common of events in Eng-
land during the reigns of Queen Elisabeth and King J 311103. The
binding to 3 011311· and such questioning as we have in this scene
was the set order for such a ceremony. (For an incident of exorcism
during the reign of Elisabeth see Revue bleue, 4, ser. Ι, 1894, p. 656, .
translated from 19th Cen. Magazine.) The conception of this mode
of treatment seems to have been also influenced by ‘⁴ the strange and
wonderful way in which Don Quixote was enchanted '' (Chap.
XXXVIII), where monks also execute the means of torment.

For somewhat similar means of torture we m'ay compare Return
from Parnassus ΙΙ, 30. IV, 2, and Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, sc.
IV, 2, 3130 Comedy of Errors, Act IV, 30. 4. As another example
of possession we may compare also the pretended madness of Edgar
in King Lear, scs. ΠΙ, 4, 6, and 30. IV, 1.
