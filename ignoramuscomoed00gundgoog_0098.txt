90 IGNORAMUS.

This place (quoth she) they say 's enchanted,
And with delinquent spirits haunted,

That here are ty’d in chains, and scourg’d
Until their guilty crimes be purg’d:

Look, there are two of them appear,

Like persons 1 have seen somewhere, etc„ etc.

In Ignoramus Polla appears, on still another occasion, in her
virago-character. In Sc. ΙΙΙ, 10, she attacks at the inn her hus—
band and his companions and cudgels them to the music they
are enjoying, with which scene may be compared the second
attack upon Hudibras, ΙΙ, 11, 641 ff.; wherein verse 7 20 “ Be
claw'd and cudgel’d to some tune '' is especially suggest-ive of

influence from the above scene of IgnoramuS.

Trico—Talyol.

As Trico was the leader of intrigues against IgnoramUS, so
Talgol seems to be the leader of the mob against Hudibras (see
Hudibras, Ι, 11, 683 ff), and again like Trico is described as a

trickster.

Gola—-Oolon,

Both these men are religious or rather irreligious characters·
Compare the gluttonous, wine—bibbing monk as described in the
drama, Ignoramus scenes IV, 6, 10, and V, 11, with the fol-
lowing description of Colon, from the poem Hudibras, Ι, 11,
465:
