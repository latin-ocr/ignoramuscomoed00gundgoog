General Characteristics Common to Ignoramus and H udibras.

Before beginning a comparison of the characters and motives
in the Hudibras with those in Ignoramus, Ι call attention to
several general characteristics common to both pieces of litera-
ture. I pass by the observation that both poems seem to have
been composed with a purpose to pleasing royalty, and remind
the reader that I endeavored in a previous chapter to show that
the comedy Ignoramus was not purely and simply a legal satire,
but that it was in a measure also a religious satire. I now em-
phasize that the poem Hudibras is not only a religious satire,
in which the same sects‚ namely the Puritan and Catholic or
non-conformist‚ are ridiculed as they were made laughable in
Ignoramus ; but‘ that it is als0‚ again like Ruggle’s drama, a
legal satire. Whether the purpose of the author was to ridicule
a state of anarchy under the commonwealth‚ or that of the times
in general, does not here concern us3 the fact remains that the
poem is markedly also a legal satire. On every possible oppor-
tunity the author lets this characteristic appear. As evidence of
his bitterness against the legal situation of the timeS‚ I refer
to the following passages as well as the last canto of part ΙΙΙ,
which is almost entirely occupied with the ridicule of the law-

- yer Hiccius Doctius.

Hudibras‚ Ι, 11, 1177 ε

So J ustice, while she winks at crimes
Stumbles on innocence sometimes.

Hudibras‚ ΙΙ, 11, 325:

Is not th’ High·Court of Justiee sworn
To judge that law that serves their turn?
Make their own jealousies high treason‚
An fix ’em whomsoe'er they please on!
Cannot the learned connsel there

Make laws in any shape appear?

Mould 'em as witches do their clay,
When they make pictures to destroy,

And vex ’em into any form

That fits their purpose to do harm!
