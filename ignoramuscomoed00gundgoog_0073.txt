1. PonMs nv Pmsn 011* THE COMEDY IGNORAMUS.

In connection with and following the first performance of
the comedy IgnoramuS, a number of poems were composed, of
which the following are still extant.

A Cambridge madrigal, consisting of sixteen four-line
strophies was composed as an answer to the poem, known as the
Oxford ballad. The poem is entitled: “A Cambridge Madrigal
in answer to the Oxford Ballad, as it was sung before the king,
instead of Interlude music in Ignoramus, the second time acted
before his majesty, in Trinity College Maii 13, 1615.” A
copy of this is preserved in t-he Brit. MuS. Sloane MSS„ No.
17 7 5. It is reprinted by Mr. Hawkins (ed. Igno., p. cxv).

Another poem of twenty-four verses draws a comparison be-
tween the entertainment of the king on his first visit to Cam·
bridge and his previous visit to Oxford in 1605. The poem, al·
though somewhat satirical towards both universitieS, is rather
partial towards Cambridge. It is printed by Mr. Hawkins (ed.
Igno., p. xxxvii).

A Latin poem, consisting of fifty-four verses, celebrates the
second coming of the king to Cambridge. The title is as fol-
lows: “ De Repetita Cantabrigia: Sive, De adventu Regis ad
Musas secundo, Liber licentiatuS.”—A MS. copy of this poem
ie, according to ΜΓ. HawkinS, preserved in Trinity College,
Cambridge, Β. 14, 22. It is also reprinted by him (ed. Igno„
p. xliv).

Two poems were written as advertisements of the drama and
accompany most of the editions after the first. One, written
in macaronic form, consists of ten verses. It is entitled “ Dul-
man in laudem Ignorami '' 3 the other contains seventeen verses
and bears the title “ Encomiasticon in Ignoramum.”

A poem of - twenty-two verses prefixed to the first edition
of a Latin drama entitled Pedantius, written in 1580-81 ac-
cording to Prof. Moore Smith, but not published until 1631,
