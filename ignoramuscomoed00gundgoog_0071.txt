ooMrAmsoN wrrH LA TBAPPOLARIA. 63

the lineal descendant of PhilomusuS, Academico and Studioso
of the Parnassus dramaS. ·Also Dulman and PecuS, although
they correspond to Dentifrangolo and Leonetto as far as the
carrying out of the main plot is concerned, are, in being oppon-
ents of Musaeus and academie learning, under the same in-
fluence. Dulman is only a translation of stupido. The direct
influence however upon these characters from the Parnassus
plays is slight. These characters appear in the following sceneS,

which are unrelated to the story of La Trappolaria, viz: Scs. 1,
33 ΙΙ, 6; IV, 7, 113 V, 3, 10.

(d) Uola, the Monk.

The interesting figure of the debased monk is entirely foreign
to the plot of La Trappolaria. His introduction into the play
‘⁴ Ignoramus ’' was first suggested by his friend Cupes, sc. IV, 5,
in order to assist in the exorcism of the demented lawyer. The
picture of this monk is not ¹essentially unlike the pictures of
the priest in John Heywood's interludes3 though the partS,
which he plays as the exorcisor of Ignoramus, scs. IV, 10,
11, seem to be those of the priest in Don Quixote, who, ac-
companied by the barber, was directly or indirectly the means
of getting that hero in many of his difficulties. (For other
examples of exorcism see above, p. 53: ) The spirit of the
satire reflected indirectly upon this character and the verseS,

which he and his friend Cupes ‘use, suggest influence also from·
Skelton. ’

(e) Bannacar and RicharduS, Servants to Theodorus.

These characters are entirely new, but they play very insig-
nificant parts, The most important incidents are the conversion
of Bannacar, the Moor, from Mohammedism to Christianity
through the instrumentality of his master, TheodoruS, and the
refusal of this servant to comply with the cruel command of
this same sels-righteous master, viz: to kill Rosabella. See sc.
V 6.

’ (f) vince and Nezz.

These two attendants of Dorothea are of the fool type, com·
mon in Shakespear. They appear together, scs. V, 1 and 2.
