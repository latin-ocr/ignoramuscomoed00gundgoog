From the date of the second performance we have no record
of Ignoramus being placed again upon the stage for nearly one
hundred years3 although within that interval it had passed
through at least six reprints. However at Christmas, 1712, it
was enacted on three consecutive evenings by the scholars of
westminster, and again just before Christmas, 1713, there were
three presentations of it at the same school. It was also on two
subsequent occasions used by the Westminster scholars, as a
means of Christmas merriment‚ namely in 1730 and 1747. 011
both of these occasions there were, by special request of the
audience‚ four presentations of it instead of three as formerly.
In 1731 it was enacted at St. Edmund’s Bury, in Suffolk, and
in 1763, in an abridged form, it was enacted at Merchant Tay·
lor's school. Ravenscroft's adaptation‚ “ The English Lawyer,''

was performed at the Royal Theatre in London‚ 167 8.1
