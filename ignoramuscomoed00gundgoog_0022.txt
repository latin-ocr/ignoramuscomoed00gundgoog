14 IGNORAMUS·

bers of the university: yet there· were certainly present in the
mind of our author also weightier and worthier motives than
that of simple resentment. That it was not taken merely as a ’
persona] satire is evidenced by the general resentment and
numerous retorts which its first two performances are said to
have called forth from the profession as a whole. (Letter, of
Mr. Chamberlain‚ see above, p. 8. ) Α1 1116 61666 of the six-
teenth century and the beginning ”of the seventeenth there was
waging at the universities a bitter strife between the advocates
of the civil law and those of the common or statute law of
England. King J ames and the majority of the clergy were
known to have strong predilection for the Roman law. The
king is said on one occasion to have shaken his fist in the face
of Lord Ohief-Justice Ooke‚ because the latter ventured to
assert that the ecclesiastical jurisdiction was a foreign one.
(Mullinger, Univ. of Camb„ Vol. 11, pfl, 528.) But it was not
only the common law as a principle th'at Ruggle wished to
bring into disrepute‚ it was also first of all the debased, almost
unintelligible language3 then, in the next place, the character
and false methods of the common lawyers as a class that he
wished to satirise. (See Ward, Eng. Dram. Lit., edit. 187 5,
Vol. ΙΙ, p. 368.) A fair picture of the type of lawyer which
Ruggle intended to satirise in* the character of IgnoramUS, as
well as a good example of the wit in the satire is reflected in
the conversation between the wily Trico and Musaeus, the
university student and discontented clerk of Ignoramus, Act

IL, 66. 6.

Musaeus. Trico, narrabo tibi Aenigma3 tu conjice.

Trica Narra.

Musaeus. Quid illud est, quod jure vixit et injuria3
Quod magni—pusillanimum3 quod ambidexter et bifrons3
Quod multa dicit et nihi13 quod jocosa serio, seria joco;
Quod Anglice‚ Saxonice, Gallice et Latine loquitur,
Neque tamen Anglice, neque Saxonice, neque Gallice, neque

Latine loquitur3

Quod leges scripsit, ne sient captiones3 quod captiones
