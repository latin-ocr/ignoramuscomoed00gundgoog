first half of the seventeenth century, but whose famous 111303-
101110 poem, ‘⁴ Polemo-Middinia,'' was not published until
1691.ι This work therefore appeared sixty years after the
publication of Ignoramus.

The claim of Skelton to the use of the true macaronic style
is unwarranted. Contrary to the requirements of macaronic
writing, the basis of Skelton's poems is English, not Latin.
He commingles with the English only sparsely Latin and
French. He often repeats rhymes by means of an arbitrary
addition of new syllables, but they 310 new formatione simply
and solely for the purpose of rhyme, and do not conform to
Latin inflectione and Latin constructions, as the true macaronic
always does. Skelton is a pedantic writer with the addition of
his new rhyming trickS.

It is to Ruggle, to whom the distinction is due, of first intro-
ducing the macaronic influence into England3 an influence
which may have had a connection with the formation of the
famous Macaroni Olubs of London in the third quarter of the
eighteenth century. To Ruggle is due also the distinction of
being, in all probability, the first of all Europcan writers to
introduce the macaronic style into comedy. This distinction
has been accredited to Moliere, in his “ Malade Ι1113ς1113110,”2

which appeared, however, fifty years later than Ignoramus.
The first utterance of Ignoramus as he first steps upon the stage,
sc. I, 3, is “ Phi, Phi tanta pressa, tantum crowdum.'' Igno-
ramus and Dulman mingle such expressions with their Latin
throughout the drama but the height of ludicrousness is attained
when Ignoramus recites to Rosabella, sc. I, 5, his versus Legales.
They are as follows:

‘⁶ Si possem, vellem pro te, Rosa, ponere pellem
Quicquid tu vis, crava, et habebis singula bravaz ‘
Et dabo Fee simple, si monstras Love’s pretty dimple,
Gawnos‚ silkcoatoS‚ kertellos‚ et petticoatos‚
Farthingales biggos, stomacheros‚ et periwiggos,
Pantofflos, cuffos‚ garteros, spanica ruffoS‚
Buckos et soccos, tiffanos et Cambrica. Smockos,
Pimpillos, pursos: ad ludos ibis et ursos.”
