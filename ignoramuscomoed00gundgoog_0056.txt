48 IGNORAMUS.

When Polla, Act ΙΙΙ, 00. 9, reaches home and raps at the
barred door, to her surprise and indignation, a strange woman
appears at the window. Polla believes this to be no other than
a mistress of her husband. She, therefore, stigmatizes her with
the coarsest epithets. She tries to force an entrance to the
house, but failing in this, she makes a tou'r of the inns in search
of her dissolute husband to make him pay atonement for his
01110.

Τ1110 000110 and Act ΙΙΙ, Sc. 8, of La Trappolaria are entirely
similar in fable, and the likeness in phraseology is rather greater

than usual. This scene in La Trappolaria is in imitation of the well-
known scene in the “ Mercator '² of PlautuS, wherein Dorippa mis-

takes, Pasicompsa for her rival.

In Act ΙΙΙ, 00. 10, Ρο110 finds Cupes at an inn engaged in
lively conversation with musicians, whom he had hired to add
merriment to the banquet which he was about to enjoy with his
clerical drink-fellows. Polla, from without, hears her husband,
the innkeeper and fiddlers making many a derogatory jest at
her expense. Finally all join in singing the following song of
her husband's own composition: ‘⁶ Cupis uxor Polla ΙΙ Ο 01 fran-
gat colla! ΙΙ Polla, ΙΙ ΟοΠο·; ΙΙ Dispereat, ΙΙ Intereat. ΙΙ Uxores
pari sorte ΙΙ Pereant pari morte3 ΙΙ sorte, ΙΙ Morte3 ΙΙ Dispere-
ant, ΙΙ Intereant.” ΙΙ Ρο110 now no longer restrains her pent-up
anger, but breaks in upon the company, overturns the tables
ladened with viands now ready for the feast, pours out the wine,
and inflicts sore chastisement upon her caluminators. Then
with dire threats she requires her husband to give her the house-
key and follow her home. Thither she hastens and without
mercy turns Rosabella out of the house.

The scene we have just related has its essentia] conception in La
Trappolaria, Act III, Scenes 9 and 10; however, the plan and tone
are considerably altered. While in our drama the events transpire
as above related, in the Italian drama Fagone remained at home, after
he had brought Felesia thither; and was there to receive and quarrel
with his wife, when she reached the house. In the tenth scene, when
the cook comoe to the house to make preparations for the feast, which
Fagone expected to celebrate with the strange woman, then Gabrina’s
wrath was so stirred that she ended in driving Felesia out of doors.
