COMPARISON wrm LA TRAPPOLARIA. 57

they were in English waters near Detfordia on the ThameS‚ a
nurse, named Ursula, with a child named Isabella (the daugh-
ter of a London alderman named Manlius and his wife
Dorothea), had been enticed upon board the ship, and then
borne away from their native land. The nurse had died at sea,
but the child then four years old was carried to Portugal and
there sold to Alphonsus, wh0, having no children, adopted her
and reared her as his own daughter. These utterances of
Bannacar convince the parents that Rosabella can be no other
than their own long lost child. If any doubts remained they
were dispersed when Bannacar produced a signet, which he had
long treasured, and which, marked A. & Ι. (for Antonius and
Isabella), Theodorus recognizes as the identical one which he
years before had given the child Isabella as a token of her be-
trothal to Antonius. Theodorus has naturally no further ob-

jections to the union which he himself had arranged and there·
fore accords both his children his fullest favor.

This scene, as above related, differs in plan essentially from that
of Act V, Sc. 4, of La Trappolaria, where Trappola comes and falsely
announces the shipwreck‚ and certain death of Arseni0, which causes
the father Callifrone to suffer remorse, and also renders him willing
to pay Trappola any amount of money for the recovery of his son
Arseni0, exactly what Trappola wished to accomplish. Again, while
the recognition in Ignoramus is effected through the testimony of
Bannacar and the signet, in La Trappolaria it was already effected
at the beginning of scene 3, simply through the story of Filesia her-
self and a mothel-'s and daughter’s intuitive power of recognition.

In Act V, sc. 8, Theodorus expresses his sincere gratitude to
Trico and Bannacar, and handsomely rewards them both.
Vince comes and announces the arrival of Antoninus and Catha-
rine from the harbor.

This scene finds its essential conception, like the preceding, in Act

V, Sc. 4, of La Trappolaria. There is, however, no verbal corre·
spondence.

In Act V, sc. 9, Pyropus, the tailor comes once more, whom
Antonius receives kindly, and renders him his full dues for the
use of his costume. Vince is also present and acts the clown
and dare-devil.
