42 1GNORAMus.

Scene 5 presents Trico and Antonius imposing upon Pyropus‚
the tailor (since they have no more money), a worthless ring,
as a guarantee for the costumae which they have just received.

The events of this scene find their counterpart in La Trappolaria,
Act ΙΙ, Sc. 5. However, as usual, they are narrated in an altogether
different style.

In Act ΙΙ, sc. 6, Musaeus in a monologue complains of the
treatment he receives at the hands of his master. He then
meets Tric0‚ to whom he propounds an enigma. After Trico
guesses that it concerns IgnoramuS, and after they both ex-
change most satirical remarks directed against the lawyer,
Musaeus informs Trico that his master is about to go in person
to claim Rosabella. Trico at once requests Musaeus to go
hastily and bid Cupes and Antonius be ready to receive the
lawyer, according to the prearranged plan.

This scene has no corresponding one in La Trappolaria. The tone
reminds us again of the Return from Parnassus· The ridicule heaped

upon the ignorant, pedantic, conscienceless lawyer Gullio (Ret. f.
Par„ Part Ι, Acts III, IV and V) and upon the venal Sir Raderick

and his compliant lawyer, Sir Recorder (Ret. f. Par„ Part Ι, ScS. ΙΠ,
1, 2, 4, and IV, 1, 2), all of whom were bitter antagonists of the
University, finds its counterpart in· the ridicule loaded upon Igno-
ramus in this scene. The following speeches have possibly some verbal
correspondence.

Bet. from Par„ I, Sc. IV, 1, l. 1153. It is my custome in my com-
mon talke to make use of my readinge in the Greeke, Latin, French,
Italian, Spanishe poetts, and to adorn by oratorye with some prettie,
choice extraordinarie sayings.

I ynoramus, Sc. II, 6. Quod Anglice‚ Saxonice, Gallice et Latine
loquitur, etc. of. also above, prologus Ι, p. 41.

Ret. from Par„ II, Sc. IV, 2, l. 1712. Ι pray you Monsieur Ploidon,
of what University was the first lawyer 013 none forsooth, for your
Lawe is ruled by reason and not by arte, etc.

I ynoramus, Sc. II, 6. Quid illud est quod jure vixit et injuria, etc]

Act II, sc. 7, Ignoramus appears with the six hundred gulden
which he had pledged Torcol for Rosabella. Trico meets him,
and in order to win time, for Cupes and Antonius to complete
their arrangements, he represents that he would like to retain
him as his counselor in a ludicrous case which he inventS.
