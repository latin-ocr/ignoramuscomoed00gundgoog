deep impression upon the young author, and in all likelihood
influenced materially the composition 01 IgnoramuS, performed
some sixteen years later.

There was also performed at St. J ohn's College between the
years 1597 and 1601 a series 01 111100 plays entitled, “ The
Pilgrimage to Parnassus '' and “ The Return from ParnassuS,''
in two parts. In these three dramas is reflected distinctly the
discontent 01 1110 scholar and the contemptuous feelings mutu-
ally existing between him and the common civilian. Moreover
through the scathing satire, in the third and fourth acts 01 the
last 01 this series, poured out upon the head of the recorder,
again said to be Francis Brackyn3 and, moreover, by reason 01
1110 1301 that these dramas are copiously interspersed with Latin
as well as by reason 01 passages in Ignoramus which suggest
influence from these dramas3 it becomes evident that particu-
larly the last part 01 1110 Return from Parnassus has in pur·
pose, character and form (and might it be also in authorship)
a close kinship with the drama Ignoramus. In 1601, 1110 same
year in which the last 01 1110 trilogy 01 playS, mentioned above,
was performed at St. J ohn's, the townsmen drew up a formal
statement 01 their grievances, wherein they speak 01 being
abused on the stage (see Mullinger's Hist. 01 Camb., Vol. II,
p. 442), and in the year 1604 Κ1118 J ames sent a royal letter
to Cambridge, forbidding the enactment within five miles 01
1110 town, among other games, “ Common plays, public shews,
interludes, comedies and tragedies in the English tongue.''
(Mullinger, Univ. 01 Camb., Vol. ΙΙ, p. 42 9.) May it not be
primarily these early events and this royal letter, that deter-
mined Ruggle to give his efforts 10 the writing 01 3 Latin

Thus 131 we have gone upon the assumption that the strife
between Cambridge scholars and Cambridge townsmen 1111-
nished the prompting motive for the writing 01 our drama. It
is indeed probable‚ almost certain, that there is present in this
work, as also there was in ‘⁴ Club Law '' and the “ Return from
Parnassus,” a purpose to bring into ridicule those 01 1110 com·
