coMPAmsoN wrm LA TRAPPOLARIA. 49

The introduction of musieians in our drama, and the placing of the
scene in the inn makes the conversation assume quite another tone.
There is here almost no verbal corroepondence with La Trappolaria.
The song in this scene is written in Skeltonian verse.

Act ΙΙΙ, se. 11 brings Antonius to the house of Cupes in hope
of seeing there his Rosabella. He is thrown almost into des-
pair, when Oupes informs him, how Polla had expelled Rosa-
bella from the house. As Aeneas sought his Creusa, so An-
tonius goes forth again to seek, he knows not where, his beloved.

This scene may be said to be a condensation of Act IV, Sc. 2, of
La Trappolaria. Only a few speeches have no counterpart in the
Italian drama; however, what claims five pages in the original is in
our drama contained within the limits of a little more than one.

Act III, sc. 12, presente to us, on one part of the stage Rosa-
bella oomplaining of her fate. At the same time, on another
part, Antonius unseen by the former continues his search and
complains of his ill-fortune, while on still another part Cupes
bitterly laments the loss of his sumptuous feast.

In Act ΙΙΙ, sc. 13, as a closing scene to the third act Igno-
ramus comes again in search of Torcol‚ but, as Cupes sees the
lawyer approach, he remembers to blow his horn, and the enemy
hastily recedes.

This episode has no correspondent in the Italian drama. (See
above, Se. H, 8.)

Act IV opens with the reunion of Antonius and Rosabella.
After a brief but hearty greeting, the former at once unfolds
to his beloved Trico’ s plan, by which they may enj oy the com-
fort and security of Theodorus' home. The plan is this, that
they shall represent to the father, that they are the recently
married Antoninus and Catharine 3 and that they have just come
from London. To this end Antonius had had painted upon his
cheek a birthmark like that of his brother. They must also
speak English.

This scene just described and Scene 12 of the third Act follow the

plot of La Trappolaria, Act IV, Sc. 3. In both scenes only nine
speeches are directly dependent upon the Italian source.

While they yet discuss the plan, the father TheodoruS, Act
