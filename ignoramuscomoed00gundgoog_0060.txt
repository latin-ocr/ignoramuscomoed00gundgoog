52 IGNORAMUS.

This scene follows the plot of La Trappolaria, Act IV, Sc. 7, and
has with it also the following similarities of speech.

Dray. . . . poiche in iscambio di Iyrw. Quid ergo non portasti Rosa-
recarmi la mia Felesia mi reehi bellam mihi?
quella vecchia contrafatta.

Den. V'ho recata quella. istessa, Dal. Illam Rosabellam portabam
che, mi consegno il Ruffiauo, quam Torcol deliberabat mihi.
Dray. Come lo eonoscesti? Iyno. . . . num habebat curvum

collum?

Ignoramus had in the meantime sent Pecus to Torcol, to
claim the true Rosabella. Torcol however believed this to be
only another stroke of Trico, therefore he casts the messenger
into a dungeon and then exultantly proceeds to Ignoramus. In
Act IV, sc. 8, the two men meet, and after comparing notes
they both realize how completely they have been outwitted.
Ignoramus threatens Torcol for embezzling money from him ⁴
and unjustly casting hjs clerk into prison. Torcol pleads inno-
cence, and, finally, they agree to go to Theodorus to see if they
can learn from him the authors of this strategem of which they
have been the victims.

This scene just described is in plot entirely similar to Act IV, Sc. 8,
of La Trappolaria. It has, however, almost no verbal correspondence
with it.

Act IV, sc. 9, presents to us the father, TheodorUS, and Rosa-
bella sitting before the door of his house engaged in conversa-
tion. As the girl sees her uncle, Torcol, in company with Igno-
’ ramus and Dulman draw nigh, she is naturally filled with
anxiety. NeverthelesS, when they wish to lay claim to her as
Rosabella‚ she plays well her role by continuing to speak Eng-
lish3 and protests that her name is Catharine. Antonius is
summoned. He also appears as Antoninus and suggests to his
father that these are the possessed men of whom they had heard.

This scene which we have just described is a condensation of the
fable as it is contained in the ninth, tenth and eleventh scenes of
La Trappolaria, Act 4. The principal difference in plan is herein3
that at the end of scene 11 in La Trappolaria the Captain and Ruffiano
are frightened awayr by Arsenio drawing a dagger and threatening
them; while in Ruggle's drama, at the end of scene 9, Ignoramus,
Torcol and Dulman remain to be treated, in the following scene, by
