APPENDIX. 103

value upon his majesty, and therefore invited him to accept of those,
which his majesty took and gave his hand to kiss3 and so he took his
horse, and rode before the king’s mace-bearer to Trinity college3 and
then the mayor took his horse and rode before the king's mace-bearer,
with his mace over his shoulder, all the rest of the company leaving
him, or lacking by him, which needed not, for he had 2 footmen, tired
in watchet saye, with workvelvet jackets, and the arms of the red-
coats wore at the fairs sewed to them. His majesty made no stay
till he came at Trinity college walk, where him and the prince and
his nobility alighted their coach3 and being within Trinity college,
against the first rails, Dr. Gwyn, deputy vice-chancellor, made an
oration to him, giving him thanks for his love to them, that he was
pleased· again so suddenly to come to them again, and highly extolling
his majesty and virtues3 the vice-chancellor and heads kneeled whilst
this speech was delivering, and the king stood, the prince and nobility
by him3 and· then, the speech ended, his majesty went towards his
lodge3 and then, about the middle alley, the orator made another ora-

laughed exceedingly3 and sometimes with his handS, and by words,
applauded it. On Sunday, at 9 of the clock, there was a sermon in
St. Mary's; at half an bour past ten the king went to Trinity chapel,
where he heard prayers and an anthem, and then a clero in Trinity,
made by Mr. Simpson of Trinity, which was an hour and an half
long, which seemed too tedicus to his majesty, and· therefore he
shewed some distaste, not of the clerc, for it was well and learnedly
performed, but that he had no care to prevent tediosity, he being
wearied over-night3 the clero ended, there was another anthem sung
and prayers, and then his majesty went to dinner; at 3 a sermon in
St. Mary'S, before divers of the nobility3 after dinner about 4 of the
clock, his maj esty went to Mr. Butler, with his nobles: the sheriff
Aldered of Foulmere was very officious, and took upon him his office
before his majesty, which discontenting the university, the vice·
chancellor, upon notice given him, informed Mr. lord chamberlain,

majesty's pleasure he should not carry himself then as a sheriff, for
