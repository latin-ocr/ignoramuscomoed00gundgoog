84 IGNORAMUS.

While we assign Ignoramus as Butler's source for this motive,
it is necessary that we acknowledge at the same time another
source from which Butler drew. Particularly at this point,
Butler blended with the plot of Ignoramus, that of a drama
attributed to Mr. Tompkis‚ entitled Albumazar, ² the Astrologer,
which like Ignoramus was founded on a comedy of Giam
Battista Porta, namely L'Astrologo, and which, furthermore,
formed a part of¹ the entertainment provided for King J ames
the First‚ during his first visit to Cambridge, being performed
before him the next evening following the first presentation of
IgnoramUS.

Whereas Ignoramus, in company with Torcol and Dulman,
goes, at the end of Sc. IV, 8, to the house of Theodorus in order
to make inquiries in reference to Rosabella, and while there
he is attacked by the monk and his allies, Hudibras, on the
other hand, goes, Part ΙΙ, canto III, to Sidrophel, the Astrol-
oger, in order to learn of him his destinies in love, and while
there, he quarrels with, vanquishes and robs the astrologer.

In Albumazar Pandolfol is in love with Flavia, and goes to
the astrologer, Albumazar, in order to interest him in his behalf.
He finally quarrels with him, and while pretending to be robbed,
he deprives the astrologer of jewels which he had promised to
give him in exchange for his services. Thus far the history of
Hudibras, as contained in part ΙΙ, canto ΙΙΙ, corresponds very
well with the plot of Albumazar3 but at this point Butler re—
turns to the experiences of Ignoramus. Ι11 part ΙΙΙ, canto Ι,
while Hudibras is at the home of his lady relating to her
of his victory and his obedience to her commandS, he is sur—
prised by a company of furies and hobgoblins, who chastise the
false hero in a manner entirely similar to that in which Igno—
ramus was handled by the monk. There is nothing in the his-

tory of Pandolfol, which corresponds to the chastisement and
eroes-examination, which Hudibras suffers in part ΙΙΙ, canto I,

Merry Wives of Windsor (Sc. V, 5) 3 however questioning as to sins, etc„

has no place in the treatment of Don Quixote and Falstaff as it has in the
torture inflicted upon Ignoramus and Hudbras.
