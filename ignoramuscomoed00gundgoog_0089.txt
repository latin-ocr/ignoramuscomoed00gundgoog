Ignoramus, Sc. ΙΙ, 83

lym. Per Deos, si unquam posthac, tollite Hispanicos companiones.
Trica. Quin tu fugis jam?

Cup. Sequere, sequere; quo fugit?

tyno. Sum salvus, et sanus nunc; titillabo vos3 monstrabo triccum de ·

lege. Quoniam juravi, non ibo ipse, sed mittam clericum meum Dul-
man pro Rosabella.

Hudibras, ΙΙ, 11, 553

Whether it be direct infringing

An oath‚ ii I should wave this swingeing,
And what I’ve sworn to bear, forbear,
And so by equivocation swear,

Or whether it be lesser sin

To be foreworn than act the thing.

HudibraS, III, 1, 505:

Why then (quoth he) may Hell surprise-
That triek (said she) will not pass twice ς
I've learn'd how far I’m to believe

Your pinning oaths upon your sleeve.

Compare further Hudibras, ΙΙ, 11, 269 ff.; also III, 1, 405 ff.

6. Ignoramus and Hudibras are both sensual, selfish and false
lovers who purpose to marry only for money. In the eomedy
Ignoramus this lust for money is apparent also in the charac-
ter Theodorus. The above-named characteristics are made very
prominent in the Hudibras.¹
IgnoramUS, Sc. Ι, 53

Rosabella was supposed to be poor, therefore Ignoramus says:
“ nam cum venio in Angliam, maritabo mihi divitem uxorem3
et tum tenebo hane in commendam tantum pro transi-tempus.''

Hudibras, ΙΙ, 1, 439:

Quoth she, I grant you may be close

In hiding what your aims propose.
Leve-passione are like parables‚

By which men still mean something else.

² In lasciviousness Hudibras corresponds well with Falstaff : But Falstaff
never thought on marriage as Ignoramus and Hudibras do. Neither did
Falstaff calculate how much money a woman had. It is merely sensual
gratification on which he thinks. Don Quixote, like Ignoramus and Hudi-
bras is an ardent lover, is also like them disappointed and baffied: but un·
like them, he is no sensual, selfish false lover, his love is an idealized one,
it is pure, generous, constant.
