ooMPAmsoiv wrrH LA TRAPPOLARIA. 39

vious advice of Trico (so as 'not to awaken the suspicion and in-
terference of Surda), is making, as it were angl-y gestures toward
Rosabella and at the same time trying to console her grief, who
in turn tells him of the sig-ned contract for her delivery to
Ignoramus.

The incidents of this scene just narrated find their counterpart to
some extent in the third and fourth scenes of La Trappolaria. The
plan is, however, changed by the introduction of the new character
Surda. In the third soene of La Trappolaria Arsenio and Feloeia
are alone and in the fourth scene Trappola joins them. In the above
scene of Ignoramus Antonius and Rosabella, Trico and Surda, on
different parts of the stage engage at once in simultaneous dialogues.
While in La Trappolaria the conversation between Arsenio and Feloeia
is long ; that between Antonius and Rosabella, in Ignoramus, is very
much condensed from, and has slight verbal correspondence with, the
Italian. The plan to deceive Surda and the entire conversation in
signs between Trico and Surda has naturally no correspondent part
in La Trappolaria. The situation reminds of Romeo and· J uliet,
Sc. H, 2, where the lovers converse and the nurse is ignorant of what
is transpiring.

Act I, sc. 7, brings Torcol again upon the scene, who disturbs
the lovers' happiness, Surda is whipped. She appeals earn-
estly to her imagined lover for protection. Trico and Antonius

quarrel with, and threaten Torcol. Rosabella and Surda are
finally led awa53 and Torcol also retires.

The idea of this as a quarrel scene is borrowed from the fifth scene
of the Italian drama. The following speeches have verbal or thought
correspondence z
