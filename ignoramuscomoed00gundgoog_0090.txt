82 IoNonAMUS.

Though love be all the world’s pretence,
Money’s the mythologie sense ;

The real substance of the shadow,

Which all address and courtship's made to.

Compare further Ignoramus‚ Sc. Ι, 1, and Hudibras‚ ΙΙ, 111,
515 ff.‚ also ΙΙΙ, 1, 523-1288.

7. Ignoramus and Hudibras both endeavor to please the
women they pretend to love with laughable promises and poetic
effusione clad in legal phrase.

Compare, in particular, Ignoramus‚ sc. Ι, 5, and HudibraS,
ΙΙ, 11, 67 7—686, also Ignoramus‚ scs. IV, 9, 10, and Hudibras‚
ΙΙ, Ι, 283 ff„ also III, 1, 163 ff.¹

8. The characters Ignoramus and Hudibras correspond 111
that in the action of the respective workS‚ all the movements and
plane of these heroes are baffled in practically the same manner
and both receive the same manner of treatment at the hands
of their 9119111198.

(a) The gelders horn is employed as an instrument of terror
to both Ignoramus and Hudibras.2
IgnoramuS, Sc. II, ’ἴ 2

Qui, me audiente, castrare Ignoramum
Velle se, si deprehenderit.

Ignoramus, Sc. ΙΙ, 8:

Conduxi qui castraret, statim aderit
(Cupes intro cornu sonat, ut castrator)
Trin—Tran3 Trin-Tran 3 Trin-Tran.

Quin tu fug-is jain?
Sequere, sequere 3 quo fugit?
Ignoramus, Sc. III, 13:

² The device of the letters and cffusive promises addressed by Hudibras to
the widow may well be compared with the letter 91111 soliloquies of Don
Quixote addressed to the lady Dulcinea; but the tone of infidelity and the
legal phraseology in Hudibras's Iove effusions is rather that of Ignoramus
than Don Quixote. Falstaff also sent Mrs. Pago such a letter, but it is
without legal phraseology.

² A horn is used several times in Don Quixote‚ apparently as a signal of
alarm, but there is no intimation of a gelders horn (Cf. “ Don Quixote,’'
chaps. 2, 41, 70).
