94 IGNORAMUS.

(f) Both horses are for sale.
IgnoramuS, Prologue 1:

Numquis jam emet ridiculum hunc caballum? Cabal. Sine ut inspec-
tem,

HudibraS‚ ΙΙ, 1: Can 1 bri roof
Where, when, by whom, anltligvsshat y’ were sold for,

And in the open market toll’d for?

The peculiar incident of pulling or tweaking noses is common
to the drama Ignoramus and the poem HudibraS.
Ignoramu5‚ Sc, Ι, 4:

Dabit tibi hoc privatum signum, capiet te per nasum sic. Igno. Sc. ΙΙΙ,
2. Dicis bene. Ne sit breve eri-orie, injunctum est mihi vellere te per
nasum. Igno. Sc. III, 6. No'n oe, sed nasum volo, veniat nasuS, nasa·
liter in Curiam, ut faciat homagium nasale.—O placide hoh, placide. Ο,
oh, oh.-—An est signum r-Oh clementer, signum est, sai: est, oh oh.

‘Hudibraffi Ι, 11, 97 3:

To ronse him from lethargic dump,

He tweak’d his nose 3 with gentle thump
Knock’d on his breast, as if ’t had been
To raise the spirits lodg’d within.

They, waken'd with the noise, did fly
From inward room to window eye3

And gently opening lid, the casement‚
Look’d out, but yet with some amazement.
This gladded Ralpho much to see,

who thus bespoke the Knight 3 quoth he,
Tweaking his noae, Yon are, great Sir,

A seli-denying conqueror 3

Hudibras, ΙΙΙ, 1, 1155:

There’s no way to reduce him thence
But twinging him by th’ ears or nose.

Word-play upon the legal terme junctura or jointure and
issue is a marked feature in both Ignoramus and HudibraS.
Ignoramus, Sc. I, 5:

Dabo tibi bonam juncturam: faciam ames me plus et plus, Audi junc-
turam tuam.
