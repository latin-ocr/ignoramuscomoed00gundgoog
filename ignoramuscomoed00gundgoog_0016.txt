8 IGNORAMUs.

Mr. Chamberlain, dated May 20, 1615. “ On Saturday last
the king went again to Cambridge, to see the play IgnoramuS,
which hath so nettled the lawyerS, that they are almost out of
all patience3 and the lord chief justice [Sir Edward Coke]
both openly and at the king's bench, and divers other placeS,
hath galled and glanced at scholars with much bitterness: and
there be divers inns-of-court men have made rhymes and ballads
against them, which they have answered sharply enough: and
to say truth, it was a scandal rather taken than given3 for
what profession is there wherein some particular persons may
not be justly taxed without imputation to the whole? But it is
the old saying, conscius ipse sibi3 and they are too partial to
think themselves so sacro-sancti that they ma)r not be touched.
The king had a Latin sermon on Sunday and disputations on
Monday before his coming away '' (Birch MSS. collections).1
