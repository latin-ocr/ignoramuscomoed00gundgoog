(a) Both horses are 'spoken of as runaways.
IgnoramuS, Prologue 1:

Num quis Musarum caballum vidit hic?

Oyez,—oyez,—oyez; Musarum habal-lus aberravit modo, nomine Davus
Dromo . . .
Ergo velim hunc Davum Dromonem in pistrinum dari.

HudibraS, II, 1, 699:

Or should I take you for a stray,

You must be kept a year and day

(Ere 1 can own you) here i’ th’ pound,
Where, if γ’ are sought, you may be found. ,

(b) Both are monsterS, half horse, half man,²
IgnoramuS, Prologue 1: *

Qui semihomo et totus caballus est, ’

Homo {uit 3 sed cum homo non magis saperet quam caballus, iratae Musae,
quas vexabat indies, mutarunt eum in caballinum hominem.

Hudibras, 111, 1, 1339:
Unhappy wretch!

What hast thou gotten by this fetch,
Or all tny tricks, in this new trade,
Thy holy brotherhood o’ th’ bladei

By saunt'ring still ou some adventure,
And growing to they horse a Centauri

(c) Descriptions of the Horses.

Ignoramus, Prologus 12 Hudibras, I, I, 4232 .

biceps bestia, vegrandi capite, et The beast was sturdy, large and tall,
recalvastro, perlongis auribus, ru· with mouth of meal, and eyes of wall.
bicundo rostro, quasi ore patulo, I wou’d say eye3 for h’ had but one,

labris prominentibus,— · As most agree; tho’ some say noue.
Hudibras, ΙΙ, Iz
juba curta et subrufa,— A sorrel mane?
Hudibras Ι, I, 445:
excoriato dorso,— His strutting ribs on both sides
show’d

Don Quixote (see above, p. 25, f.) , it becomes apparent, we believe, that
Butler was little indebted to Cervantes for his picture of the horse; aud
that he was influeuced here primarily by Ignoramus.

⁸ Hudibras is, metaphorioally, called a Centaur for being so inseparably
attached to his horse. Dromo, in the hobby-horse, is made a monster be-
cause of the anger of the Muses.
