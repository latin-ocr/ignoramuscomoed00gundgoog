LITERARY INFLUENOE. 87

Hudibras, when he purposes to betray the falsity of his master,
divulges it directly to the widow.

Polla—Trana.

Polla, of the comedy IgnoramUS, and Trulla, of the poem
HudibraS, have correspondence in the following common char-
acteristics:

(a) Both women are described as stout viragOS, who, in con-
sideration of part of the booty, consent to assist their husbands
in inflicting punishment upon Ignoramus and Hudibras respec-
tively‚

Ignoramus, Sc. ΙΙ, 3:

Cup. Vel maxime. Allicere autem ut possim, vereor ;
Morosa aden, jurget semper, etiam, Trico me verberat.

Tri. Num furia?

C'up. Im0, TricO. Vel una omnes furiae.

Tri. dcto ecce aureos,
Cup. Da mihi, et ducam Danaem.

IgnoramUS, Sc. II, 4:

Polla. Mihi des aumm3
Effectum reddam optime, mi CupeS.
Gap. En duos aureos:

Postquam effeceriS, alteros tantos dedero,
Polla. Convenit. . . .

HudibraS, I, 11, 365:

He Trulla loved3 Trulla„ more bright
Thau burnish’d armour of her Knight:
A bold virag0, stout and tall

As ‹Joan of France, or English Man.
Thro’ perils both of wind and limb,
Thro’ thick and thiu, she follow'd him,
In every adventure h' undertook,

And never him or it forsookz

At breach of wall, or hedge surprise,
She shared i' th’ hazard and the prizez
At beating quarters up, or forage
Behav'd herself with matchless cour-age 3
And laid about fight more busily
Thau the Amazoniam dame Penthesile.

(b) For the lasciviens character of the two women, compare
IgnoramUS, Sc. V, 11, and HudibraS, I, 11, 379—408, also ΙΙ, 11,
640—'7 52.
