56 IGNOBAMUS.

ing his master of his Christian principles, Rosabella now
recognizes in Bannacar the former slave of her own father
Alphonso, who, as he was about to die at Fessa, presented his
slave with freedom. Bannacar therefore the more steadfastly
declines to execute his master’s wish. When Theodorus still
insists, Rosabella, now overcome by grief and fear, swoons away
in a faint. Trico, who has overheard all, hastens away to in-
form Antonius of this situation.

This scene and all the following ones are developed in quite a dif-
ferent manner from the remaining history of La Trappolaria, even
though incidents here and there in the two dramas have similarities.
That part of the scene above described, in which Bannaoar relates the
history of Rosabella's life and which he gives more fully in the next
scene, has its counterpart to some extent in the narrative of her own
life, which Felesia gives in the first part of Act V, Sc. 3, of La Trap-
polaria. Otherwise this scene is new in plan. It has no verbal cor-

In Act V, sc. 7, Antonius arrives. Seeing Rosabella lying
in a faint, he at once concludes that his father had in reality
caused the death of his beloved. His grief is now so great that

When Rosabella had recovered, Antonius implores his father’s
favor upon his marriage with Rosabella. Somewhat penitent of
his cruel conduct, the father now inquires more particularly into
the girl’s origin. Rosabella herself relates that she had been
the daughter of Alphonsus, a Portuguese noble, and that when
dying at Fessa, her father had entrusted her to the care of her
uncle, Rodrigo Torcol. She relates further that the latter,
while coasting along France had suffered shipwreck and lost
all his fortune, after which he had remained in this country and
had begun business here in BordeauX. Bannacar, who is now
asked for his knowledge of the matter, answers that the girl
has spoken the'truth so far as she knew it. He asserts however
that Rosabella was not the daughter of Alphonsus, as she sup—
posed, and then proceeds to tell what had been until that time
a secret history. He relates that he himself had formerly been
a servant to a Moorish merchant named Urtado, and that, as
