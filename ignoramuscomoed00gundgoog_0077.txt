LITERARY INFLUENOE. 69

Τ110 third edition is without date, but the Brit. Mus. 0010-
logue assigns the year 17 37. Τ1113 edition in the Brit. Mus,
is bound together with five other workS. The title-page reads
as follows: “ Ignoramus: or the English Lawyer, a Comedy as
it is acted at the Theatre in Dublin. Written by Edward
Ravenscroft. Gent. Dublin.'' Copies of these three editions
are preserved in the Brit. Mus.

The Westminster editions of 1731 and 17 37 have also some
claim to the name of adaptatione. The edition of 1731 con·
tains new prologues used by the king's scholare of Westminster
in their presentation of the drama in the years 1712 and 1713.
The edition of 1737 0011101113 111030 used at the same school in
the years 1712, 1713 and 1730. These editions have also an
additional fifth act which was prepared and used for the pres-
entations at Westminster.

For lack of knowledge concerning the true title of a drama
performed before King J ames in the year 1616, I have assigned
to it a title as above. Of the causes which led to the composi-
tion of this drama and its presentation before the king, Oharles
N isard in 1113 work entitled “ Les'Gladiateurs de la Republique
des LettreS,'' Vol. II, p. 102 f. , gives the following interesting
account. Speaking of Gaspar Schioppius and a satire, entitled,
‘⁴ Legatus Latro,'' written by him against King J ames 'and his
friend Casaubon,¹ N isard says : , “ Oasaubon etait mort l'annee
precedente: mais Jacques etait plein‘ de vie, et en 30 vengeant
soimeme, il songea aussi 0 venger son ami. Bruler un livre etait
chose si commune qu'un auteur efit ete bien delicat, qui efit cru
pour 'cela 0110 deshonore. Pour fletrir SchioppiuS, il fallait⁴un
autre moyen, J acques pensa l'avoir trouve.

¹ Isaac Casaubon, the distinguished classical scholar, was born at Geneva,
1559, was at first a Calvinist and vehement opponent of Catholicism. In
May, 1610, 110 went to England, became a close friend of King James Ι, and
also an ardent adherent of the English Church and was therefore bitterly

persecuted by the Puritans as well as by the Catholics. He died in Eng-
land in 1614 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.
