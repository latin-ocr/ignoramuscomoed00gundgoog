LITERARY INFLUENCE. 93

Like furrows he himself had plow’d3
Hudibras, Ι, 1, 434:
pedibus anterioribus ulcerosis, Had corus upon his feet and toea,
Ignoramue Prologue, Ι. Hudibras, 1, 1, 449 ι
at caudam pulchellum habet . . . His draggling tail hung in the dirt,
Gauda est pulchra satis, hae Which on his rider he did flirt.
muscas a Musis abigo.

(d) Both steeds are fieet.
IgnoramuS, Prologue I:

At erat Incitatus nobilis et velox equus; tu segnipes caballus·

Egon'? qui tot regioneS, plerasque etiam sine viatico, pererravi saepius.
Quin eursu provoco omnes nobilium hio praesentium equos celeripedes,
sive Puppy, sive Franklin, sive Poppereorn, sive Cropmr, . . . et nisi
tintinnabulum vindicem ego, caudam oui-tate mihi:

HudibraS, I, 1, 427 ε

He was well παγάς and in his gait,
Proserv'd a grave majestio state.

At spur or switoh no more he skipt,
Or mended pace, than Spaniard whipt3
And yet so fiery, he wou’d bound

As ii he griev'd to touch the ground:

(e) Both steeds are ferocious kiekers.
IgnoramuS, Prologue I:

Gur. Oh, ferox calcitret

Equ. Compellamus illum altrinsecus in istum angulumz blande puer3 ι
poppysmate palpemus eum.

Ambo. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho Messe, ho Dave, ho,
Messe Dave, ho Dromo, ho Messe Dave
Dromo, ho, Messe Dave, ho Dromo ho.

Bou. Ah nequissima bestia, vin’ aufugere? non tu Davus Dromo jam, sed
dromedarius· ’

HudibraS, Ι, 11, 845:

The angry beant did straight resent

'l'he wrong done to his fundament3
Bega-n to kiek, and Πίος, and winae,

As if h’ had been beside his sense,
Striving to disengage from thiale,
That gall’d him sorely under his tail:
Instead of which, he threw the pack

of Squire and baggage from his back 3
And blund’ring still with amarting rump,
He gave the Knight's steetl such a thump
As made him reel.
