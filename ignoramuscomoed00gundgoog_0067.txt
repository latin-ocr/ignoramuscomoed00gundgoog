with some spirit of rivalry, what parts each of them had per·
formed during the course of the play. Instead of one speaking
an epilogue‚ they in turn praise the merits of the king and fill
their cups in his honor. They then call down the following
curses upon all those who will not render his majesty hearty
allegiance.

TricO. . . . uxores Polla infestiores habeant.

Cupes. Iidemque stupido Dulman stupidiores, et inficeto Ignoramo audiant
inficetiores.

Trica. Iidemque, opera carnificis, torto collo sient, magis quam ipse
Torcol.

Then each exultant in his success drains his glass, first how-
ever calling upon the entire audience to drink with them to
the health of the king. “ Salute Domini nostri, pii, felicis,
semper Augusti.” They invite applause and the curtain falls.

The curtain rises once more, and in the midst of uproarious
applause, Ignoramus comes forth and cries Silence! Peace!
Peacel He endeavors in vain to appeal to the sympathy and
protection of the king. The uproar continues and again he bids,
though in vain, the audience cease its laughter and applause.

SUMMARY.

1. INFLUENcEs FROM LA TRAPPOLARIA.

We have observed that the main plot of the comedy Ignora-
mus is essentially identical with that of La Trappolaria. The
comparison of dramatis personae of the two dramas, page ΖΞ,
shows that every character of the Italian drama has a corre-
sponding one in Ruggle's drama. This does not, however, ex-
clude the fact that the author of Ignoramus displayed great
originality in his freedom from the language of his source and
also in the additions which he made to it. Of the fifty-five
scenes, which compose the comedy Ignoramus, thirty-seven fol-
low, with slight modifications the story of La Trappolaria.
Interspersed among these, eighteen new scenes have been added,
which have no correspondence with the Italian source. These
newly introduced scenes are the two prologues and scenes I, 3,

4, 53 11, 6, 7, 83111, 133 IV, 5, 6, 10, 113 v, 2, 3, 10,11‚ 12.
