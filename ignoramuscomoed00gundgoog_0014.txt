5. The Piscatory, an English comedy, was acted before the univer-
sity in King’s college, which Master Fletcher, of that college had
provided, if the king should· have tarried another night. (Gentle-
man’s M ay„ May, 1756, p. 223.)²

The first present-ation of “ Ignoramus '' was given, therefore,
on the evening of the eighth of March, 1615, the day following

entertainment on that occasion, is derived from a letter of ΜΓ.

or indeed of anything he witnessed3 yet we have ample other
evidence, that its performance was a marked succeSS, and gave
the king the utmost pleasure. Of this indeed the best witness
is the fact that within a little more than two months after the
first presentation, the king made another visit to Cambridge, for
the pleasure of seeing Ignoramus enacted a second time.

to have the actors come hither, which will be a difficult thing
to persuade some of them, being preachers and bachelors of
