APPENnrx. 101

Old Sir John Outts is lately dead, and here is such a speech of the
lord Rosse; but there is no great credit given to it, because it comes
only out of the low Oountries. Your nephew Oarleton is arrested
with the smallpox, which hindered his journey to Cambridge.

I had almost forgotten, that all the courtiers went forth masters
of Arts at the king's being there; but few or no doctors, save only
Younge; which was done by mandate, being son to Sir Peter, the
king's school-master. The vice-chancellor and· university were ex·
ceeding strict in that point, and refused many importunities of great
men; among whom was Mr. Secretary, that made great means for
Mr. Westfield: but it would not be: neither the king’s intreaty for
John Dun would prevail: yet they are threatened with a mandate,
which if it come, it is like they will obey, but they are resolved to
give him such a blow withal, that he were better be with-out it.
Indeed the bishop of Chichester, vice-chancellor, hath been very stiff,
and carried- himself very peremptory that way; wherein he is not
much to be blamed, being a matter of more consequence than was at
first imagined. He did his part every way, as well in moderating the
divinity act as in taking great pains in all other things, and keeping
exceeding great cheer.

I have here sent you the questions in brief, for otherwise they would
bear too great bulk. And so Ι commend to you the protection of the
Almighty. From London, the loth of March 1614

Your lordship’s to command,

15 Maii 1615.
A 3 Weeks before the day early notice was given, both to the deputy
viee-chancellor, and to the actors of the comedy called Ignoramus,
that his majesty, at his going up to London from Thetford and New·
market, where he had sported, was fully resolved to hear the said
comedy acted again3 whereupon the actors were suddenly called to·
gether, and they made speedy preparation, as well for the altering

· and adding something to the plot ; and in the interim whilst this was ,

prepared, certain J esuits or priests, being to be conveyed from Lon-
don to Wisbich castle, were not suffered to come through Cambridge,
but by the sheriff carried over the back side of the town to Cambridge
castle, where they lodged one night, which the vice-chancellor did
carefully and wisely to prevent the dangers which might have ensued,
