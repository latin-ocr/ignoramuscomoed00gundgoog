LITERARY INFLUENGE. ’75

Hudibras, ΙΙΙ, 1, 46:

He held th' achievement was too glorious
For such a conqueror to meddle

With petty constable or beadle ς

Or fiy for refuge to the Hostess

Of the Inns of Court and Chaneery, J ustice ;
Who might, perhaps, reduce his cause.

To th’ ordeal trial of the laws

Where none escape, but such as branded
With red-hot irons have passed bare-handed ;

Hudibras, ΙΙΙ, 1, 609:

Such hideous sots were those obedient
Old vassals to their ladies regent,
To give the cheats the eldest hand
In foul play by the laws o’ th’ land ;

Compare also Hudibras ΙΙ, 11, 197-2003 281—23 612—14:
ΙΙΙ, 1, 1449-56: also III, 111.

It might also be here observed, under general characteristics‚
that there seems to have been a desire on the part of Butler to
write his poem in the maearonic form as Ruggle did his Igno-
ramus ; but this feature will appear under a comparison of the
characters themselves, therefore I make no further reference to
it here.

COMPAmsoN on CHARAo‘rn-ns ΛΝΒ ΙΝΟΙΒΕΝΤΒ.

The characters in both pieces of literature may be divided into
two classes, namely the ridiculed party, and the opposing or
ridiculing party. Ignoramus and Hudibras are both legal ehar-
actere, who go with their clerks or attendants into disgraceful
company and are involved in absurd adventures They are de-
feated by practically the same number of men and women, who
are united at best in thwarting all the movements of these two
mock-heroeS. These two parties strive often among themselves
and always against each other. This feature of strife between
the two opposing parties in Ignoramus‚ and the strife at times
within those parties is likely that which caused Butler to see
in it a type of the warfare between and within the politieal and
religious parties of his time, and therefore a suitable plot for
his satire.
