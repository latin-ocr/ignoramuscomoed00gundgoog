26 IGNORAMUS.

biceps bestia, vegrande capite, et recalvastro, perlongis auribus, rubi-
cundo rostro quasi ore patuln, labris prominentibus», juba curta et
subruffa, excoviato dorsu, pedibus anterioribus ulcerosus, colore vario,
cum rotunda macula in clune nigricante.'' ¹Don Quixote's horse, like
that in the prologus under consideration, is a racer and is also com-
pared with other horses of fame: “it seemed as if wings at that instant
had sprung on Rozinante, so lightly and swiftly he moved '' (Chap.
XIV ); “ neither Astolpho's Hippogriff, nor the famous Frontin0,
which cost Bradamante so dear, could match thee in speed '' (Chap.
XX). Of. Ignoramus, “ Quin cursu provoco omnes Nobilium hic
praesentium equos celeripedes, sive Puppy, sive Franklin‚ sive Pep-
percorne, sive Orop·eare, sive Snow-ball, sive Saucie J ack, Frecke,
Spanyard, Peg with a Lanterne, Strawberries and Oream‚'' etc. With
these fanciful names we may compare again another passage from
Don Quixote which treats of the magic horse: “ ‘ His name,' answered
the Trifaldi, ‘is not the same as the horse of Bellerophon, which was
called Pegasus ; nor is he called Bucephalus, like that of Alexander the
Great3 nor Brilladore, like that of Orlando Furios03 nor is it Bayarte,
which belonged to Reynaldos of Montalvan; nor Frontina, which was
the steed of Rogero; nor is it BoeteS, nor Pyrvis-names given, it is
said to horses of the sun, etc.” (Chap. LXXIII). Moreover, the pas-
sage in Ignoramus immediately following the one quoted above men·
tions also a magic horse: “ neque etiam quemvis equum vel fatidicum,
vel magicum recuso·

SEOON D PROLOGUE.

The interest of the second prologue consists in its being a
trial scene, wherein two characters are brought upon the stage
one after the other and tried before Ignoramus and his clerk
Dulman. The first to be examined and sentenced is the same
Davus Dromo, alias Messe Davy, who was ridiculed by the use
of the hobby·horse in the first prologue. The second person
to appear before the mock·tribunal was a character representing
the famous German scholar, and champion of the Pope, Gaspar
SchioppiUS, who had not only written against Protestants in all
Europe, but had also for various reasons satirized King J ames
without mercy.

This trial of theSe two representatives of the Catholic church
suggests influence from W. Turner’s “ Examination of the
MaSS,'' a work written, and in all probability performed at
Cambridge, about the middle of the sixteenth century. In this
