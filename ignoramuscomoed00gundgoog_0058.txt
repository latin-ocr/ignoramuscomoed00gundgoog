IV, sc. 2, appears. He can scarcely ⁸be induced to believe that
the young man, with whom he speakS, is not his son Antonius:
Yet because of the birthmark, and because Antonius had
brought for him letters from Dorothea (which however Trico
had composed), and because the pair speak English, he is
finally convinced that they are in reality his children from
London, Antoninus and Catharine.

This scene follows entirely the plot of La Trappolaria, Act IV,
Sc. 4. The language in this scene is, however, independent of the
original.

Act IV, sc. 3, adds Trico to the company of the foregoing
scene. Though the contriver of the deception, he now appears
reluctant to believe that there is not here some mistake. In
order to gain confidence with Theodorus he does what he can
to make him believe that these are not Antoninus and Catharine.
At last, however, Trico pretends also to be convinced. When
all is peace, Trico and Antonius see Pyropus, the tailor coming,
which fills them both with great uneasiness. Trico withdraws
to avail himself once more of Cupes' assistance.

The first third of this scene bears some verbal likeness to the same
part of Act IV, Sc. 5, of the Italian source. The remainder of the
scene is similar only in plot.

Act IV, sc. 4, brings Pyropus into the presence of the father
and son muttering complaints because of the worthless ring
which Trico and Antonius had imposed upon him and lays
claim to the clothes which Antonius is now wearing. The
young man continues to speak English, and declares to his
father that he does not know the man. Nevertheless the father
has now grave suspicions in reference to the affair. Finally
Antonius is almost in despair of longer keeping up the decep-
tion.

This scene corresponds in plan to Act IV, Sc. 6, of the Italian
source. However, instead of the tailor going away, at end of scene,
to appeal to law, as in La Trappolaria, in our drama he remains
during the following scene, there to be further undone by Trico and
Cupes. Possibly one third of the speeches in this scene are in imita-
tion of corresponding ones in the original.
