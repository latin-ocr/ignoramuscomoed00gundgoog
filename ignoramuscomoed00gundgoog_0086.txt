78 IGNORAMUS.

Ignoramus, Sc. ΙΙ, 6:

Quod multa dicit et nihil, quod jocosa serio, servia joco; quod Anglice
Saxonice, Gallice et Latine loquitur, neque tamen Anglice, neque Saxonice,
neque Gallice, neque Latine loquitur3

HudibraS‚ I, 1, 91:
But when he pleased to show it, his speech
In loftiness of sound was rich3
A Babylonish dialect,

Which learned pedants much affect.

It was a party-colour'd dress

Of patch’d and pye·ball'd languages:
'Twas English cut on Greek and Latin
Like fustian here-tefore on satin.

It had an odd promiscuous tone,

As if h’ talk’d three parts in one;

Which made some think, when he did gabble‚
Th’ had heard three labourers of Babe13
Or Cerberus himself pronounce

A leach of languages at once.

This he as volubly would vent

As if his stock wou'd ne’er be spent3
And truly to support that charge,

He had supplies as vast and larges

For he cou’d coin or counterfeit

New words so debas’d and hard, no stone
Was hard enough to touch them on;

And when with hasty noise he spoke 'ern
The ignorant for current took 'ern ς

Butler, moreover, frequently caused Hudibras to interlard
his speeches with Latin, which leads us to conjecture that, had
Butler had more skill in the use of Latin, he would have caused
Hudibras to 'use more largely that dialect, which has been de-
scribed in the foregoing passages as being so characteristic of
him3 just as Ruggle did with his character Ignoramus.

3. It is apparent not only through their dialect, just referred
t0, that both Ignoramus and Hudibras are pedants3 but it
appears also in nearly every sentence they utter. Notwithstand·
ing this, both are despisers of academie learning. Ι present the
following passages for comparison.¹

² Don Quixote was scarcely a pedant, certainly no despiser of academical
learning. Satyre Menippee furnishes some ridicule of pedantry, but not 01 a
nature, we think, to have influenced Hudibras directly (cf. Sat. Men„ Edit.
Ratisbone, 1714, pp. 62, 76, 155, 207).
