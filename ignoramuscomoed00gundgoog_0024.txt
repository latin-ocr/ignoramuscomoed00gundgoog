Ut aequum est, suspicimus: nam et a nobis et pro nobis sunt.
Scientiae,
Nisi IgnoramuS, hostis nemo est. Ignoramus igitur illiusque
simileS,
Qui ecclesiam et academias pessundatas cupiunt—
Trico. Valeant. Musaeus. Imo eant in Morboniam.

This passage just quoted may serve also to introduce the
observation that our drama mirrorS, less distinctly to be sure,
also other phases of the social and political life of the day.
Scorn is meted out copiously to two religious parties of the
time, namely the Puritan and the J esuit in the following
manner.

Possibly Ruggle could have cast no greater slur upon Puri-
tanism than to make Ignoramus a member of that party, yet
that is what 116 (1066, when he, in the‘ above passage, causes
Musaeus to answer the question “ Ubi gentium natus 2” with
the sentence “ In magna Puritana.'' This sect is also certainly
included in the illiusque similes, when Musaeus again says,
“ Ignoramus igitur illiusque similes, 'qui ecclesiam et Aca-
demias pessundatas cupiunt—imo eant in Morboniam.'' More·
over the character Theodorus, as he is portrayed in soenes I,
13 1, 83 and V, 5, 6, 7, is sels-righteous, grasping, exacting
and stern to cruelty, all of which is in striking contrast to the
tenderness and compassionate love of Callifrone, the corre·
sponding character in La Trappolaria, wh0, unlike Theodorus,
only sends his son away from the city to save him, as he believes, ’
from an evil associate. This figure in our drama is certainly
typical of the austere Puritan character. It is important to
note here, that Ruggle is said to have written a drama entitled
‘⁴ Re Vera '' or “ Verily '' expressly to satirise the Puritans.1

That the comedy Ignoramus was received by the J esuits as
an offence is clear from the account of the king's second visit,
which we reprint in an appendix hereto. The satire against
this faith is expressed in the drama in several ways. In both
