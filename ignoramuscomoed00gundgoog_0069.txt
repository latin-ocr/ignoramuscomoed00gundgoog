COMPARISON WITH LA TRAPPOLARIA. 61

ΙΙ,1 which has not only ‘the laughable 'figure of the lawyer

Δ Tressillian, but which may have also suggested to Ruggle the

name of his hero, Ignoramus. The character Mr. Ignorance,
bayliff of Dunstable (here an allegorical place mentioned also
in both prologues to the comedy Ignoramus) , ² is prominent in
this drama and speaks sc. ΙΙΙ, 3, also of his brother, Master ,
IgnoramuS. It is probable, however, that the term Ignoramus
had long been a common term of opprobrium for an ignorant
person.⁸

This lawyer Ignoramus of Ruggle's drama is introduced, sc.
I, 3, in the role of the “ pedant in love '' (for history of this
character see Oreizenach's Geschichte des neueren DramaS, Bd.
II, s. 280). Mr. Ruggle seems to have been influenced in this
respect especially by the Latin drama “ Pedantius ’' enacted
also in the presence of Cambridge scholarS, according to Prof.
Smith as early as 1581. (See edit. of Ped., p. x.) ⁴ One of
the differentiating features of Pedantius from other dramas
of its genus is the manner in which its hero uses in his con-
versations with his three pupils, in his wooing of Lydia, on all
occasions a multitude of academical saws and philosophical
phrases, In exactly the ‘same peculiar manner Ignoramus in·
serts into his intercourse with his three clerks as well as into
his passionate love-suit of Rosabella a mass of legal terms and
phrases.

In other new soenes of Ruggle' s drama this same pedantic
figure is led into disgraceful company and ludicrous situations
In sc. Ι, 4, he is given an entertainment by Torcol, the bawd, and
his girls somewhat as in the Pseudolus (the principal source

ο 'Hie New Eng. Dict. attributes the first use of this term applied to
designate a person to Ruggles drama, but aside from the reference given
above it had been used in this sense a full century earlier by Erasmus in his
‘⁴ Encomium Moriae ’' (Praise of Folly) also by Beaumont and Fletcher in
“ The Honest Man’s Fortune‚” s’c. v, 3, just two years before the first per-
formance of Ignoramus, comp. Shakespear Jnhrbueh, Vol. XXXIV, pp.
