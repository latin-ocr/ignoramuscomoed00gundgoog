courAmsolv wrm LA TRAPPOLARIA. 51

At the critical moment, Trico, Act IV, sc. 5, returns, accom-
panied by Cupes dressed as a sailor. The latter demands money
of the young man for his passage from England. The father
is now again convinced, that this is in reality his son from Lon-
don, he therefore generously pays the sailor twenty crownS.
Moreover because Pyropus obstinately refuses to be convinced
that this is any other than Antonine, Cupes becomes angry and
threatens to thrash the tailor. By this means the latter is
frightened away3 but as he retires he threatens to appeal to
law for justice. Trico now realizes that Ignoramus would soon
be coming to reclaim his money or Rosabella3 therefore acting
upon the report, which Polla had circulated, namely that the
lawyer was possessed, he suggests to Gupes that they be ready
to exorcise him, when he appear. As a party to aid in this task
Cupes suggests his drink·comrade‚ Uola, the monk.

This scene, like the preceding, is in a measure dependent upon
Act IV, Sc. 6, of La Trappolaria3 yet the phraseology and even the
conception of it are essentially original.

While they yet speak of Cola, in Act IV, sc. 6, he appears
and requests Cupes‚ as book-vender, to sell a cowl and books,
which he had just won at dice from a brother monk. He
promises Cupes that they shall then enjoy together from the
proceeds a rare banquet. The greetings of the monk and Cupes,
as they meet, are interesting. Cup. “ O, mi confessor. Ι 001.
O, mi confessor. Ι Cup. Mi spiritualis pater. Ι 001. Mi car-
nalis frater. Ι Cup. Bibemus molle vinum. Ι 001. Sed cyath-
um ter trinum.'' When Cupes requests the monk to exorcise
Ignoramus‚ 110 readily consents

This scene just described has none corresponding to it in La Trap-
polaria. The satire of the monk as well as the few short verses in
this scene suggest Skelton's satireS, directed against a debased clergy.

Act IV, sc. 7, transfers us again to the quarters of Ignoramus‚
who has just succeeded in recapturing his clerk, Dulman. The
lawyer heaps censure upon the unfortunate servant. The latter
however declares to his master that he had delivered to him

the same Rosabella, which he had received from Torcol.
