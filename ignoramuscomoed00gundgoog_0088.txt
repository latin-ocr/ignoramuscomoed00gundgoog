HudibraS, 11, 111, 797 ε

Art has no mortal enemies, .
Next ignorance, but owls and geese.

4. We see Ignoramus upon the stage both acting and being
made a fool. The picture of Hudibras is the same. Moreover
the same epithets applied to Ignoramus are also applied to Hudi-
bras in the following passages :¹

Hudibras, I, 1, 29:

But here our author makes a doubt,
Whether he were more 11199 01 910111.
Some hold the one and some the other3
But howsoe'er they make a pother,
The difference was so small, his brain
Outweigh’d his rago but half a grain3
Which made some take him for a tool‚
That knaves do work with call'd a 1001.
For ’t has been held b‘y many, that
As Montaigne, playing with his cat,
Complains she thought him but 911 999,
Μ11911 111019 9119 wou’d Sir Hudibras3

HudibraS, I, 111, 247 ε

Whom furious 019111 111119 bespoke: ·
Shall we (quoth he) thus basely brook
The vile affront 11191 paltry ass,

And feeble scoundrel‚ Hudibras ς

5. Both Ignoramus and Hudibras make oaths, which they do
not hesitate to violate or evade, to help themselves out of
trouble? This motive is enlarged upon by Butler so that it

forms 1119 subject of discussion 10 1119 long dialogue between
Hudibras and Ralpho in the first half of canto ΙΙ, 11.

² We have already observed (p. 76) that Shakespeare’s figure 01 Falstaff
was the prototype 01 Butler's corpulent 1001. Α1 1119 1011199 01 1)011
Quixote we are forced to smile 3 11111 119 19 110 911911 1001 99 Ignoramus,
Falstaff and Hudibras. Cervantes made his hero the unfortunate victim 01
by-gone ideals and a diseased imagination3 we are compelled also 10 911911911

² Don Quixote unlike Ignoramus and Hudibras never violates his 09111.

would have been in keeping with the character 01 Falstaff.
