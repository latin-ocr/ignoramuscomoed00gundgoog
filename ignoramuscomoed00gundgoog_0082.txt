7 4 IGNORAMUS.

HudibraS, ΙΙ, 11, 349:

As when the sea breaks o’er its bounds,
And overflows the level grounds,

Those banks and dams, that, like a screen,
Did keep it out, now keep it in3

So when tyrannio usurpation

Invades the freedom of a nation

The laws o’ th’ land, that were intended
To keep it out, are made defend it.

Does not in chanc’ry ev’ry man swear

What makes best for him in his answer?

Is not the winding up of witnesses

And nicking more than half the bus’ness?
For witnesses, like watches, go

Just as they're set, too fast or slow3

And where in conscience they're strait lac'd,
’Tis ten to one that side is cast.

Do not your juries give their verdict

As though they felt the cause not heard itt
And as they please make matter o’ fact
Run all on one side, as they’re pacth

Hudibras, ΙΙ, 111, 15:

Others believe no voice t’an organ

So sweet as a lawyers in his bar-goun,

Until with subtile cobweb-cheats

Th' are catch’d in knotted law, like nets 3

In which when once they are imbrangled,

The more they stir, the more they're tangled3
And while their purses can dispute‚

There’s no end of the immortal suit.

HudibraS‚ ΙΙ, 111, 619:

Others with characters and words
Catch 'em, as men in nests do birds ς

Hudibras, ΙΙ, 111, 957 t

There’s but the twinkling of a star
Between a man of peace and war 3

A thies and Justice, fool and knave,

A huffing officer and a slave3 ,
Α crafty lawyer and a pick-pocket,

A great philosopher and a blockhead3

A formal preacher and a player,

A learn’d physician and manslayer.
