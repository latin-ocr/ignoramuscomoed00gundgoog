IV. FORM AND LANGUAGE.

The comedy Ignoramus consists of fifty-three soenes, two
prologues and an epilogue grouped in five acts. Scenes Ι, 1, 2
and ΙΙ, 1; also the first parts of soenes Ι, 43 and V, 1, are
written in Plautine iambics., The remaining soenes of the
drama are written in sprightly prose, with the exception of a
few Skeltonian verses inserted here and there, principally in
soenes Ι, 5; ΙΙΙ, 1Ο; and IV, 6.

Aside from the abundant wit and laughable situations in
IgnoramuS‚ a judicious use of several devices of language 3
namely the pedantic and Macaroni03 add greatly to the comic
effect and doubtless did a great deal toward giving the comedy
its immediate success and its enduring popularity.

PEnAnnc LANGUAGE.

Examples of the common mingling of two or more languages
are found in all European literaturcs from an early date3 as,
for example, the German poem from the middle of the tenth
century in reference to the reconciliation of Otto Ι. with
his brother, written half in Latin, half in old High German.
The name applied to this kind of mingled language in Italy
was “ pedantesca '² or sometimes after the middle of the six-
teenth century “ fidencian '' from a poem in this style by
Camillo Scrofa entitled‚ ‘⁴ Cantici di Fidenzio Glottocrilio
Ludimagistro.'' In England where the Anglo-Saxon and the
Norman lived side by side, amongst whom lived also the wander-
ing scholar and the clerical‚ who used principally Latin, such
mingling of languages had an early and natural development.
As ten Brink sayS‚ “ a Babylonian confusion of tongues saluted
the honest English burgen„ An interesting example of such
commingling is a lyric from the end of the thirteenth century
composed in Latin and French with only the last two verses in
