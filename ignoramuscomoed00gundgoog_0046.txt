38 IGNORAMUS.

he promises 10 bring presently. If, however, he should send
one 01 his clerks, the same should indicate that he was the proper
messenger by pulling Torcol' s nose.

This scene has no corresponding one in La Trappolaria. The
entertainment which Torcol gives Ignoramus has its analogy in the
second scene 01 1116 Pseudolus 01 Plautus (1116 principal source 101·
La Trappolaria) where Ballio 101 1116 dilectation 01 Calidorus and
Pseudolus exercises with a lash his servants. The negotiationes 101
1116 protegee 01 1116 bawd are also according 10 1116 plan 01 Pseudolus,
Sc. 3. La Trappolaria simply states that such negotiations had
been made.

But before Ignoramus leaves 1116 stage Torcol, Act. I, sc. 5,
summons Rosabella. As she appears and sees IgnoramuS, her
appointed husband, she bursts 11110 16616. Το1001 scolds and
11116616116 1161, 111611 places her under the surveillance 01 6 deas·
mute, named Surda. As Torcol retires, Ignoramus approaches
Rosabella and endeavors 10 console her, and charm her with
a poem which he entitles ‘⁶ Versus Legales de Rosabella '' (see
above p. 22).

Rosabella, as if she were astounded by such eloquenee, seigns
submission. Ignoramus then hastens away 10 make arrange-
ments 101· 1116 marriage; which, however, we leam from a side
remark, he intends 10 be only a sham3 101 116 says when he
returns 10 England he will then marry a rich wife and keep
Rosabella as his mistress.

This scene is also new. The pedantic love-suit 01 Ignoramus sug·
gests again influence from Pedantius. In tone the scene suggests
the courtship 01 Petruchio and Katharina in Shakespear's “ Taming
01 1116 Shrew.’' There is, however, 110 verbal correspondence. The
language is original.

In Act 1, sc. 6, Rosabella and Surda remain. Antonius and
Trico come upon the stage. The latter approaches Surda and
through 1116 language 01 signs, soon makes her believe 11161 116 is
in love with her. He even gives her a ring as token 01 his pur-
pose 10 marry her. The poor woman is thus wonderfully flat·
tered, and her attention wholly absorbed. In 1116 meanwhile
