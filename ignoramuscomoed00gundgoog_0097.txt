LITERARY INFLUENCE. 89

Shall serve thy turn. This stirr'd his spleen
More than the danger he was in,
The blows he felt, or was to feel,
Although they already made him re'el.
(d) Polla and Trulla are respectively the direct or indirect
means of bringing Ignoramus and Hudibras into an enchanted

eastle.

IgnoramuS, Se. ΙΙΙ, 8, at end:

Nune domum ibo, et vicinis haec narrab0‚ ut caveant ab illo daemoniaco.

IgnoramUS‚ Se. IV, 10:

Pol. Boni fratres, hie est ille daemoniacum hie alter illius socius, ete.
Hudibras‚ Ι, 111, 949:

Him she resolv’d that Hudibras
Should ransom, and supply his place.

Hudibras‚ Ι, 111, 972:

Striving to reaeh the enehanted eastle‚
Where stout Growdero in duranoe lay still.

Hudibras‚ Ι, 111, 1000:

But 'hulla straight brought on the charge,
And in the self same limbo put
The Knight and squire where he was shut3

Polla—Fama; the Widow.

Whereas Polla went about the neighborhood and circulated
the report that Ignoramus was a demoniao, Butler, who at

near his cell and imagines that she sees one possessed.
IgnoramuS‚ Se. ΙΙΙ, 8:

Pol. Corniearis larvuler medius fidius opinor hune hominem esse daemoni-
acum: verba certe magica loquitur. Nunc domum ibo, et vicinis haee
narrabo ut caveant ab illo daemoniaco. (Igno., Se. IV, 9.) Ant. See,
this is the possessed man you heard of. (Igno., Se. IV, 10.) Pol.
Boni fratres hie est ille daemoniacus, hie alter illius socius.

Hudibras‚ ΙΙ, 1, 123:
