66 IGNORAMUS.

draws a eomparison between the merits of the two dramas Pe-
dantius and Ignoramus. The writer of these lines claims su-
perior merit for PedantiuS, and herein it becomes apparent, that
the publisher or penner of these verses had a purpose in mind
to attraet the attention of the public to the proposed edition of
Pedantius and make it popular, through a comparison with
the already celebrated Ignoramus. The ‘poem begins thust
“ Pedantius de se: scilicet haud solus dominabitur Ignoramus,
etc.’'

We have already seen, that the performance of Ignoramus
before the king, with its cutting satire upon the oommon lawyers,
as a class, served to greatly nettle them. In order to avenge

themselves therefore they and their friends betook themselves s

to the writing of several ballads and essays denouncing ‘⁴ Igno·
ramus.'' Of these some are still extant. Among the essays of
John StephenS, Jr., 2d edit., London, 1615, pp. 29-50, is a

mixt with reproofe against the Lawyer' s eommon Enemy.’'

A poem is preserved in the Brit. Mus„ Sloane MSS„ No.
17 7 5, with the title, “ To the comedians of Cambridge, who in
three acts before the king abused the lawyers with an imposed
Ignoramus, in two ridiculous persons, Ignoramus the master,
and Dulman the clerk3 John a Stile, student of the common
laW, wisheth a more sound judgment and more reverent opinion
of their betters '' (Hawkins, edit. Ignoramus, p. 259, n. c.).

Another poem is preserved in the Brit. Mus. Harl. MSS„
No, 5191, and is entitled, ‘⁴ The Soldier’s Counterbuff to the
Cambridge Interludians of Ignoramus.” (Hawkins' Edit.
Igno„ p. lxiii, note a.)

Mr. Hawkins gives the title of still another poem as, “A
modest and temperate Reproof of the Scholars of Cambridge
for slandering Lawyers with that barbarous and gross Title
Ignoramus.'' (Edit. Igno, p. lxiii, note a.)

We have also a book which bears the title, “ The Case and
