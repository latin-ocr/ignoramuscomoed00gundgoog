60 · IGNOBAMUS.

There are also seven new characters added to the dramatis per-
sonae of Ignoramus who have no part in the Italian source,
while several otherS, particularly the one corresponding to Igno-
ramus, is so changed that they are practically new creatione.

(a) The Fiyure I qnoramus.

As far as the plot of La Trappolaria reacheS, the sea-captain,
Dragleone, is the prototype for the lawyer Ignoramus. Drag-
leone was, however, not the central figure of the Italian drama,
he was the unfortunate victim of the intrigues of Trappola,
ridicule of him was not the first purpose of the author. On
the other hand, the primal purpose of the new scenes of Igno-
ramus was to take the almost silent sea-captain of La Trappo-
laria and transform him into the ignorant, sels-conceited, pe·
dantic, language-mongering lawyer, to make of him a mock-
hero, who should become the figure of central interest, give the
drama his name, and who should only be outdone in roguery
by Trico—the Trappola (the deceiver), the hero of La Trappo-
laria. The author of Ignoramus drew the materials for these
additions in part from life in part from various literary sources.

The lawyer had been a favorite object for ridicule, since the
time of Henry VIII, when Skelton, in his morality entitled‚
“ The Necromancer,” directed his missiles against the clergy
and the. lawyers. We have in a previous chapter noted the re·
lation of the comedy Ignoramus to the Cambridge plays ‘⁴ Olub
Law''; “The PilgrimagetoParnassus’'; and “The Return from
Parnassus,'' wherein the lawyer was the butt of ridicule. Fol-
lowing these might be mentioned also other comedies wherein
the satire against lawyers is cutting. Such are J onson’s “ Vol·
pone,’' 1605, with its advocate Voltore3 John Day's “ Law
Tricks,” 16083 and Thomas Middleton's “A Trick to Oatch
the Old One,'' also 1608, in which is the character of a law'yer
named Dampit3 also derisive character sketches such as “A
mere Common Lawyer,” by Thomas Overbury. Earlier than
“ Olub LaW,'’ about 1594, according to Professor Wolfgang
Keller, appeared the non-Shakespearean drama entitled Richard
