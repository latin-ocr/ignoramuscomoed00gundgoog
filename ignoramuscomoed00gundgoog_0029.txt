MAOARomo LANGUAGE.

The term macaronic is often applied erroneously to any kind
of mixed language such as that of which we have just spoken3
but true macaronic literature requires that the basis of the com-
position be Latin, intermingled with foreign wordS, generally
from the vernacular of the writer, inflected, construed and ar-
ranged according to the rules of the Latin language. In dis-
tinction from pedantic, which makes a vulgar use of Latin,
generally for the sake of pedantic or satirizing effect, maca-
ronic language, on the other hand, solely for the sake of oomic
effect, latinizes words from another language. This style of
literature had its origin in Italy, probably in the fifteenth cen-
tury, and possibly received its name from the Italian macaroni,
the favorite dish of the peasant fflople. A certain Tifo Odasi of
Padua, who died in 1488, is generally given the credit of being
the originator of this style. He composed a satire against his
fellow-citizenS, which however was uncompleted, when he died,
entitled, “ Carmen Macaronicum de Padavinis Quibusdam Arte
Magica delusis.'' Among his imitators the most distinguished
was Theophilo Folengo, 1491—1544, who published a volume of
poe1nS, which he entitled “ Phantaseae Macaronicae.'' It is in
twenty-five parts and is a mixture of Latin, Tuscan and
plebeian words. In Franoe the first known writer of macaronic
verses was Antonius de Avena, who addressed a macaronic poem
to his fellow-students as early, it is said, as 1519. One of the
best of his works is a long burlesque account of the disastrous
expedition of Charles the Fifth in Provence. Rabelais' “ Gar-
gantua '' particularly the nineteenth chapter of the first book
is one of the most important examples of the macaronic form,
produced in France. The oldest German macaronic poem is
the “Floia,'' which first appeared in 1593. The principal in-
terest of this history to us, is to ask when this style of writ-
ing was introduced into English literature. The honor, if
honor it may be called, has been assigned by some authorities to

John Skelton, 1460-152931 by others to the Scotch poet Wil-

liam Drummond of Hawthornden, who lived and wrote in the
² See Meyers‚ Kon. Lexicon, under Macaronische Poesie.
