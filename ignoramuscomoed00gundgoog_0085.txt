LITERARY INFLUENCE. 77

Than constables in curule wit,
When on tribunal bench we sit.

Hudibras, Ι, 11, 1075:

Wherefore I think it better far

To keep him prisoner of war,

And let him fast in bonds abide,

At court of Justice to be try'd ;

Where if he appear so bold and crafty,
Tbere may be danger in his safety.

If any member there dislike

His face, or to his beard have pique ς
01· if his death will save or yield
Revenge or fright, it is reveal’d,
Though he has quarter ne’er the less
Y’ have power to hang him when you please.

HudibraS, Ι, 11, 757 ε

Shall save or help thee to evade
Τ118 hand of Justice, or this blade,
Which Ι, 1181· swerd-bearer, do carry,
For civil deed and military,

Hudibras, ΙΙ, 111, 1021:

They’re guilty, by their own confessions‚
Of felony3 and at the sessione,
Upon the bench I will so handle ’em,

2. To ridicule the vulgar dialect of mixed and corrupted lan-
guages was certainly the most apparent purpose in the character
Ignoramus. Hudibras is described also as using the same man-
ner of speech.¹
Ignoramus Prologue:

Quidni eg0, qui omnes linguas calleam, Ἑλληνικὴν Latinam, Francoise,
Castellana, Italiam„ Teuch‚ Polaski.

Hudibras ε

Beside ’tis known he could speak Greek
As naturally as pigs squeak:
That Latin was no more difficile,

Than to a black-bird ’tis to whistle, etc.

² There are slight references to a jargon of languages in Don Quixote (888
chaps. 8, 9, 11, 25, 32) ; 8180 in Satyre Menippee (see Edit. Ratisbone, 1714,
pp. 75 and 271). But in neither of these works is this a prominent char·
acteristic of an individual as it is in Ignoramus and Hudibras.
