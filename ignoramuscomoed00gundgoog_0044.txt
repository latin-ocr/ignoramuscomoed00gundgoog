36 reNORAMus.

cerning Torcol's life and character has its correspondent part, to
some extent, in the fifth scene of Trappolaria. The ridicule of Igno-
ramus has no counterpart in the Italian source; but was probably
influenced by Pedantiu8, whom we propose as a prototype of Igno-
ramus in the next scene.

Act I, sc. 3, brings before us Ignoramus in company with his
three clerks, Dulman, Pecus and MusaeuS, with whom he en-
gages in ridiculous conversation. Dulman and Pecus, ignorant
fellows, dance to the piping of their master, and use in their
speech his jargon, a miserable mixture of Latin, French, English
and Latin law-phrases. Musaeus, on the other hand, had
been a member of the university, and as is fitting a scholar,
always speaks good Latin. His sels-respect does not permit him
to flatter his master, as the other clerks dc, but he tells him
plainly that he is unable to understand the meaning of his re·
marks. He is therefore the object of sharp ridicule from Igno·
ramus and the other clerks. When, at the end of the scene, the ἢ
lawyer is left alone, in a monologue, he reveals to US, that the
cause of his nervous almost distracted state of mind, displayed
at the beginning of the scene was and is here again his passion
for Rosabella3 he says of himself, “ Sum sicut musca sine
caput, buzzo et turno circumcirca et nescio quod faci0.''

This scene has none corresponding to it in La Trappolaria. Not
only the mixed language of this scene, but also the questions of the
lawyer Ignoramus and the answers of his clerks betray the fact that
Ignoramus is to play the historic 1616 of the “ Pedant,'' and not the
ordinary pedant, but ‘⁴ The Pedant in Love.” (For history of this
character see Oreizenach's “ Geschichte des neueren Dramas,” Bd. Π,
ει. 280.) Several circumstances suggest the source of this influence.
First, there was performed at Cambridge about 1581 the Latin drama

, entitled Pedantius, a satire directed against a Cambridge professor.

This drama was differentiated· from all earlier plays of the same
genus, by th'e fact that the pedant in it was not the ordinary un·
worldly professor, but also a courtier, a man of the world. Igno-
ramus follows this innovation, he is a lawyer, a man-of-affairS.
Secondly‚ PedantiuS, the humanist professor, and his friend, a schol·
astic philosopher named Dromodotus, insert constantly into the midst
of their conversations classical quotations and philosophical phrases.
In the same pedantic manner Ignoramus and Dulman use here and
