REPRESENTATIONS. 7

divinity, to become players any where but in the university.'’
(Birch MSS. collectionS, Brit. Mus., March, 1615.)1

Another account says: “ His majesty was much delighted
with the play, and laughed exceedingly3 and oftentimeS, with
his handS, and by wordS, applauded it.'' (Account of the king's
second visit, reprinted in appendix hereto.) , Sir Edward Ooke,
lord chief justice, who himself was very much hurt by this
satire upon his profession says of it: “ Never did any thing so
hit the king's humor as this play did, so that he would have it
acted again and again3 which was increased with several addi-
tions, which yet more pleased the king (Detection of the Oourt
and State of England, 3rd, edit„ 8vo, 1697, Vol. I, p. 74).²

The second presentation of the comedy Ignoramus took place
Saturday evening, the 13th of May, 1615, and, as we have
seen above, pleased the king, if possible, even more than the
first enactment.³ The effect produced upon the rest of the
audience by our drama was various. We may believe that the
large majority of the audience laughed with the king3 but the ·
lawyers and possibly certain CatholicS, Puritans, and Oxford
scholare, who were present or heard of it, took great offense at
this portraiture of the time and its usages, and old animosities
and jealousies were rekindled and fanned into a blaze.

Several records give us some idea of the sensation produced,
both at Cambridge and elsewhere, by the first two presentationS.
One is as follows: “And we are told that between the scholars
of the university and the common lawyers it occasioned so
great a disturbance that the insults of the former became in-
tolerable3 and to such a height had these tumults risen, as to
require the interposition of the lord chancellor to quell them;
which by explaining the author’s intention was at length
effected.’' (Sir Fulke Greville's “ Five Years of King J ames,
4to, 1643, p. 60.)⁴ Another interesting description of the
situation appears in still another letter of the afore-mentioned
