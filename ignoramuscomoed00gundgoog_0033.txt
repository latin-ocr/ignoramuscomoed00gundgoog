utmost contempt. Cursor tells him, “ Imo transcendes ab equo
ad asinum.'' Finally as the last degree of disgrace he is told,
“ Hinc te jam ducam igitur, quo dignus es, ad Ignoramum, is
te semper posthac, inequitabat.''

As we have shown in a previous chapter, this character Dromo had
once sought at Rome ecclesiastical preferment. He therefore in sev·
eral respects seems to have a correspondence with Philomusus and
Studioso of the “ Return from Parnassus,'' who had also gone to
Rome on like errand, and who being disappointed in this hope re·
turned in great want to their native land and there among other
occupatione contemplated becoming actors.²

The following passages of this scene suggest influence from “ Par-
nassuS.”

Ret. fr. Par„ Act ΙΙΙ, Sc. 1, 1. 1159. Δ “ If ans·r man or woman, can

tell any tydings of a horse with fowre seete, two eares, that did straye

A Dromo appears also as a character in the Pilgrimage to Parnas-
sus, but in another r61e from Davus Dromo in ’ Ignoramus.

The picture of the horse in this prologue shows signs of influence
also from Don Quixote: “ he went to view his horse, whose bones
stuck out like the corners of a Spanish real, being a worse jade than
Gonela'S, qui tantum pellis et ossa fuit '' (Chap. Ι). “ Rozinante was
most wonderfully deliniate'd, so long and lank, so lean and feeble,
with so sharp a back-bone '' (Chap. IX). Of. description of horse in
